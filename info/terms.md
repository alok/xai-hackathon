Functions




























Function Stack


A




Activation

Referring to the Animals pulling energy from a Function. Every Animal in the top 3 Animals (not counting the 4th Animal) has "two wires" with each wire pulling energy from a separate Function. For example, Savior Blast pulls energy from the De and Oi Function. Sleep pulls energy from the Di and Oi. So in this example, the Oi is "Double Activated" and the De and Di are both "Single Activated".


Addictions



Addiction to Saviors



ADHD (ADD)

The classic description for ADHD is what we have independently defined in the OP system as an ExxP tidalwave. Disorganization, lack of focus, difficulty with details, hard to stay on topic, followed by a swing of being controlled. This disorder clusters in types that are Savior Oe, De, Play, Blast, with Sleep or Consume last.
