A BEGINNER'S GUIDE

Introduction
What We Do:  When typing clients, we sit in separate rooms so we don't influence each other and work through our checklist that narrows down to one of 512 possible personality types.  This means, there is a 1/512 chance we got the same type as each other.  The odds of us having the same type as one another most of the time (60-90%) over thousands of times, is a 1/trillions (impossible).  We see in our data that people of the same 512 type have high clusters of genetic features.  People of your exact type will often have these traits in common: Hair color, height, weight, facial features (doppelgängers), sexual preference, mental disorders, health issues, career, spouse, addictions, entertainment, etc.  We claim that what we are tracking is genetic.   

 

Predictability:  Our entire personality system works by going down a checklist of 9-11 binary coins.  If these coins are genetic, and we have defined them correctly, and we have typed a client correctly, then we have arrived at some kind of genetic personality type.  The results have been that the predictability of a person goes through the roof.  What we are seeing at scale is exactly what you see when you look at your spouse, kid, or coworker of 10+ years.  If they are very controlling, then you know that chaos is coming for them.  If they are very selfish, then you know the tribe is getting sick of them.  You already have extreme predictability of a few people in your life because you have accurately gotten to know them and their patterns.  Like Carl Jung theorized, people play out on a very predictable pattern.  If you can predict one person, and you have the code figured out, you will be able to predict everyone.    

 

You Got Me Wrong:  What we have tried to make clear from the beginning, is MOST people will not agree with their true type.  The natural response to the genetic coins is to pick your opposite side.  For example, the chaotic person's self-story is that the more they gather, the more they will have control someday.  The more the Extroverted person talks fast and runs in circles, the more Introverted time they'll have later.  The Sensory person will give you a list of facts of why they are Intuitive dominant.  The joke is, most people don't see the joke!  Most people go to their dying day holding onto the story that their recurring life problems are NOT them (unconsciousness and blame).  So, when you see someone freaking out about how we "got their type wrong" know that this is normal.  It's rare to have anyone be calm and conscious enough to actually look outside their delusional self-perspective.

REMEMBER TO FORGET

• The key to OPS is identifying someone's unconscious genetic driving fears.

• Your brain will try and protect you from seeing your unconscious fears by typing yourself upside down.

• The following information is a basic summary of what we use to type people on a spectrum of 512 types.  

• You are responsible for how you use this and process this information.  It is not our job to "convince" anyone.

Saviors & Demons
The Sensory person sees themselves as Intuitive, the Extrovert sees themselves as an Introvert, the Thinker sees themselves as a Feeler, etc.  Most people never stop to really understand, process, and download how typing personality traits actually work.  Most people, most of the time, just look at their self report and go, "I resonate with that, I do that!" and can't understand why their type is off.  The default biases of the human brain have a really hard time processing that this is NOT one or the other.  Everyone does everything on a spectrum.  

 

You have and will relate to all of the coins and all of the types to some degree.  You are a Thinker AND a Feeler.  You use Sensing AND Intuition.  Everyone has everything.  These personality coins work very much like right-handed and left-handed dominance.  If you are right handed, you will never brag about how good you are with your right hand.  You will only "wake up" and think you are awesome when you use your non-dominant side.  The right/left handed analogy is the simplest way to think of these personality coins, so hold onto that.  You have and use both.  The question is, which one is dominant and which one is behind?    

 

The key to understanding the OP system is zooming out and seeing that everyone is not just "dominant" on one side of each coin, but actually unaware that they are blaming their inferior side for all the bad recurring things in their lives.  For example, the person who is dominant in Gathering (Oe) is so addicted to new and not narrowing down, that they force others to Control (Oi) them.  The Selfish (Di) person who is so overconfident in their way, forces the Tribe (De) to finally kick them out.  People's lives are defined by how they are going to "save the world" if they were just allowed to do more of their dominant side.  If you really want to predict people, you have to see that their lives are just about running from the fear of their shadow side.  People don't just "kind of not prefer" their shadow side, they demonize it.

REMEMBER

• Everyone can do everything, so be ready to see both in a person

• Saviors and Demons is about responsibility and blame

• Look for what is obvious and easy for a person

• Look for a person's consistent, life-long, recurring fear

SAVIORS
• Responsible, obvious, obligated, possessed by

• Actually doing, may or may not see it or like it

• What is being piled up and done more than others 

• All recurring problems come from overdoing this

DEMONS
• Blame, ignorance, awkward, run away from

• Dreams about, desires, someday, would like to be

• Void that is being left for others to do

• All recurring problems come from neglecting this

The 4 Letters
When you see the phrase "The 4 Letters'' it is usually referring to the four foundational letters from Carl Jung.  These are just how we take in information (Observers, S, N) and what we do with it (Deciders, F, T).  Like everything in the personality code, everything works in a binary coin.  So Sensing and Intuition are on a coin with each other, and Feeling and Thinking are on a coin with each other.

 

Being on a binary coin means if you are Savior Thinking, you are Demon Feeling.  If you are Extroverted in Sensing (Se) then you are Introverted in Intuition (Ni).  If your Feeling is Masculine, then your Thinking is Feminine, etc.  We will unpack all this in the chapters below, but think of this just like being right-hand or left-hand dominant.  The more you do one, the less you do the other and it's impossible to do both equally.   

 

These 4 Letters generally correspond with the modern day understanding of the brain.  Our more rational parts (NT) are part of the frontal lobe.  Where our more ancient, animalistic, parts (SF) are in the back of our brains.  The Letters are an oversimplification of many programs working together throughout the brain, so do these generalities in context.

Introverted & Extroverted
When you combine a Letter (S, N, F, T) with an Introverted or Extroverted charge (I, E) you get a Function.  For example, Thinking plus Extroverted equals Extroverted Thinking (T+e=Te).  There are 8 Functions which we will cover in the next section below: Fi, Fe, Si, Se, Ni, Ne, Ti, Te.   

Introverted in this context just means that this Function is personal or subjective.  We all have areas in our lives that are private to us, we don't want to explain them to anyone.  Over time, we build this little inner world of ours and are not interested in dropping it when something new comes along.  The more others want us to let go of it, the more we want to hold onto our Introverted Functions.   

 

If the Function is Extroverted, this just means that it is respecting the External or objective spectrum.  We all have areas in our lives where we are ready to argue and debate someone over.  We can quickly see where someone is off on the social spectrum of a topic.  Overtime, we learn, improve, and calibrate in this area.  We are not afraid to throw shit-at-the wall in our Extroverted Functions.


4
The 8 Functions
Combining a Letter (S, N, F, T) with an Introverted or Extroverted charge (I, E) produces a Function.  Everything in the personality code works in a binary coin.  The Decider coins are Fi/Te and Ti/Fe.  The Observer coins are Si/Ne and Ni/Se.  We are all born with 1 Decider coin and 1 Observer coin.  So for example, if you have Fi/Te, then you don't have Ti/Fe.  If you have Si/Ne, then you don't have Ni/Se. 

 

Fi: Responsible for holding self to the standards of what they love and value 

Te: Respects the spectrum of the reasons and what works for the tribe  

 

Ti: Responsible for holding self to the standards of what is true and works

Fe: Respects the spectrum of values and feelings of the tribe

 

Si: Finds safety and security in personal, limited, proven, real, physical structure 

Ne: Seeks out more, new, better interesting patterns, connections, and understandings

 

Ni: Finds safety and security in personal, limited, conceptual, abstract understandings 

Se: Seeks out more, new, better cool experiences, facts, and things that have happened

The 16 Types
The 4 Letters plus an Introverted or Extroverted charge produces the 8 Functions.  The 8 Functions come in sets of binary coins, of which everyone has one Decider coin and one Observer coin.  The Functions then drop into the Function stack that creates a dominance priority, or type.  This breaks down to only 16 possible Function stack/type combinations, which are famously known as the Myers-Briggs 16 types.


*Myers-Briggs Letters:  Notice the 4 letter code above each type.  Let's take the "ENTJ" for example.  These letters are from the old Myers-Briggs system, and we still use them only as a label to refer to that Function stack of Te, Ni, Se, Fi.  For example, rather than saying, "That person is Savior Te and Savior Ni" we just say, "ENTJ" to make things simple.  If you know a person's Function stack, you can figure out their Myers-Briggs letters by asking these four questions (using a Te/Ni/Se/Fi "ENTJ" as an example):

 

1st Letter:   Is the 1st Function in their stack Introverted or Extroverted? (E)

2nd Letter:  Which Observing Function is higher in their stack, Intuition or Sensory? (N)  

3rd Letter:   Which Deciding Function is higher in their stack, Thinking or Feeling? (T) 

4th Letter:   Is the highest Observing Function Introverted (Judger) or Extroverted (Perceiver)? (J) 


*The Myers Briggs logic is outdated and doesn't take in account the Jumpers (see chapters below).

The 4 Human Needs
Tony Robbins teaches that we all have 4 basic Human Needs.  The first is the need for self identity (Di).  Who am I and what do I want to do in life?  The second is the need for connection with others (De).  What are others' points of view and how can I connect with people?  The third is the need for security and consistency (Oi).  Where can I build some stability in life?  The fourth is the need for something new (Oe).  Where can I find something new to get away from this routine?  We noticed that there is a direct overlap with Tony Robbins 4 Human Needs and Carl Jung's 8 Functions. 

 

Introverted Decider (Di) Fi & Ti: Self, identity, personal standards, strive to be the best self 

 

Extroverted Decider (De) Fe & Te: Tribe, others point of view, comfort in aligning with others 

 

Introverted Observer (Oi) Ni & Si: Organize, build, hone in, security, comfort in known   


Extroverted Observer (Oe) Ne & Se: Gather, new, explore, openness, excited by options



GOOD TO KNOW

• IxxJs and ExxPs are called Single Observers and Double Deciders

• IxxPs and ExxJs are called Single Deciders and Double Observers

The Jumpers (32 Types)
Myers and Briggs thought that everyone was dominant in their top two Functions.  What we have found is that nearly half of the population is actually dominant in their 1st and 3rd Functions.  So for example, there are the "Standard" INTPs that are Ti/Ne dominant, and there are the "Jumper" INTPs that are Ti/Si dominant.   

 

Notice in the table below that the Standard Myers-Briggs 16 types are in the two center columns labeled Consume and Blast.  The Jumper types are in the two outer columns labeled Sleep and Play.  We will cover this in the Animal section below.  Take a few minutes to study the table and understand for yourself how all these parts are interacting together.



REMEMBER

• Everyone's 1st Function is a Savior and 4th Function is a Demon

• Everyone has 1 Savior Decider and 1 Savior Observer 

• Standard type's 2nd Function is Savior 

• Jumper type's 3rd Function is a Savior

*MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the 16 Types

10
The 4 Animals
When you combine a Letter + an Introverted or Extroverted charge, you get a Function.  Animals work much in the same way.  When you combine a Decider Function and an Observer Function together, you get an Animal.  Sleep is when Di and Oi work together.  Consume is when Di and Oe work together.  Blast is when De and Oi work together.  And Play is when De and Oe work together. 

 

Just like the Functions, everyone has two Savior Animals and two Demon Animals.  You can always know what someone's first Savior Animal is by their two Savior Functions.  For example, if someone's two Savior Functions are Fi and Si, then you know their first Savior Animal is Sleep.  If someone's two Saviors are Te and Ni, then you know their first Savior Animal is Blast.  The order of the Animals will be covered in the sections below.  For now, study the diagram so you can understand what the Animals are and how they come from Functions working together.



Information & Energy Animals
There are two Introverted Animals (Sleep, Consume) and two Extroverted Animals (Blast, Play).  The Animals also break down to Information Animals (Consume, Blast) and Energy Animals (Sleep, Play).  The important thing to know here is, everyone has one Savior Information Animal, and one Savior Energy Animal.

 

Information Animals (Consume, Blast)

Energy Animals (Sleep, Play)


NOTICE IN THE TABLE ABOVE

• A person's first Savior Animal comes from their two Savior Functions (Se+Ti=Consume) for example. 

• If the person's first Animal is Info (Consume or Blast) then their second Animal is Energy (Sleep or Play).

• The above table shows a type's two Savior Animals, we will talk about the two Demon Animals below. 

• The original Myers-Briggs 16 types are highlighted in white for reference.

12
Savior & Demon Animals
Like the Function stack, the Animals follow the same Introvert/Extrovert and Observer/Decider (or Information/Energy) stagger.  With the Standard Myers-Briggs 16 types, their Saviors and Demons happen to be in the same order as their Function stack.  The Jumpers on the other hand, have their 2nd and 3rd Functions switched around.  The Function stack stays the same, but the order of the Saviors and Demons change for the Jumper Types.  The Animals also can jump around their set stack like the Functions do.  

 

Take for example, a Standard Myers-Briggs ENFP.  Their Savior Functions are Ne/Fi and their Animal order is CP/SB.  Both their Savior Functions and their Savior Animals happen to follow their Function and Animal stacks.  An ENFP Jumper such as the Ne/Te-PB/SC is an example of someone who's Savior Functions jump their Function stack and their Savior Animals jump their Animal stack.


REMEMBER

• The Animal Stack staggers Introvert/Extrovert all the way down

• The Animal Stack staggers Information/Energy all the way down

• The 1st Savior Animal is determined by the two Savior Functions

• The 2nd Savior Animal has to be the opposite of the 1st Animal in regards to Info/Energy 

• The 3rd and 4th Demon Animals also have to be Info/Energy opposite

13
Information & Energy Dominant Types
Everyone has two Savior Animals and two Demon Animals.  Everyone has two Information Animals (Consume or Blast) and two Energy Animals (Sleep or Play).  What gets interesting, is the "top 3" and/or the last Animal makes a big difference in who you are.  

 

For example, the CS/BP type looks like this: Info, Energy / Info, Energy.  This type would be "Information Dominant" because 2 out of 3 of their top Animals are Information Animals.  Another way to do the math is to say, "This person has an Energy Animal last, therefore they are Information Dominant."  Study the tables below that have all of the possible Animal combinations.  

 

Notice that the last Animal is in a (parentheses).  A trick to remember, is whatever is in that parentheses, the person is the opposite dominant.  So if they have a (S) or (P) last, they are an Info dom type.  If they have a (C) or (B) last, they are an Energy dom type.


REMEMBER

• If you have Consume and Blast in your top 3 Animals, you are Information Dominant

• If you have Sleep and Play in your top 3 Animals, you are Energy Dominant

• If you have Consume or Blast last, you are Energy Dominant

• If you have Sleep or Play last, you are Information Dominant

14
Introvert & Extrovert Dominant Types
Everyone has two Introverted Animals (Sleep or Consume) and two Extroverted Animals (Blast or Play).  What's interesting about the Introverted and Extroverted energy is you can have both your Savior Functions and Animals Introverted, or both Extroverted.  So you could be II/EE or EE/II or any combination in between (see the table below).  

 

Just like how your top 3 Animals makes you Info dom or Energy dom, the same logic applies to Introvert/Extrovert.  If 2 out of your top 3 Animals are Introverted (Sleep and Consume), then you are an Introverted type.  If 2 out of 3 of your top 3 Animals are Extroverted (Blast and Play), then you are an Extroverted type.   

 

Old Myths: If your first Function and/or Animal is Extroverted, then you are an Extrovert.  This turns out to not be true much of the time.  Take for example the Ne/Fi-CS/P(B) above.  This type has an Extroverted Function first, but 2 out of 3 of their top Animals are Introverted.  So in real life, this gives this person more Introverted energy overall.  This person is going to be stuck in life because they won't do enough Play and Blast.  

 

I/E Person Defined: Everybody can do everything, so we are not defining I/E based upon old anecdotes like, "Do you like parties?  Are you more charged up by being alone?"  The problem with questions like that is everybody can answer YES or NO to those depending on the context.  What we are objectively tracking is; Is this person having an Introverted or Extroverted recurring tidalwave in their life?  Also note, we are observing this data compared to 1000 other people.  Rarely does a person's subjective view of themselves line up with how they actually are compared to 1000 other people.   

 

- An Introverted type (Blast or Play last) will have recurring life problems around being "stuck".

- An Extroverted type (Sleep or Consume last) will have recurring life problems around "not going inward".


REMEMBER

• We don't define an I/E type based on "What you like or not like to do"

• We define an I/E type based on "What can you not do?" compared to others

15
The 128 Types
It turns out, according to our research and theory, that the original Myers-Briggs 16 types are real.  There are just many different types of each of the 16 types.  Take an ENFP for example, the original MBTI description seems to describe the CP/S(B) version.  But, looking at the table below, you can see that there are in fact super Introverted ENFPs, super Extroverted ones, De ones, Info and Energy doms, etc.  This is just an example of what we are seeing with all of the types.


SUMMARY SO FAR

• We started with the 4 Letters of the brain

• 4 Letters x I/E = 8 Functions

• 8 Functions + Function Stack = 16 Types

• 16 Types + Standards & Jumpers = 32 Types

• 32 Types x 8 possible Animal orders = 128 Types

• 128 Types x 4 Sexual versions = 512 Types*

16
The 4 Sexual Versions
The way we look at all this is there are 128 types, times 4 sexual versions.  Like the math above, everyone has 2 Feminine Functions and two Masculine Functions.  Like everything else, these work in binary coins.  For example, if your Sensory is Masculine, then your Intuition is Feminine.  If your Thinking is Feminine, then your Feeling is Masculine.

 

- Feminine Functions:  Moveable, easy going, non-confrontational, forgetful

- Masculine Functions: Non-moveable, aggressive, shovey, holds onto 

 

When looking at someone's Function stack, the two Functions to pay attention to are their Sensory and their Extroverted Decider (De, Fe or Te).  These are the two Functions that determine someone's sexuality of their Functions and modalities.  

 

Let's take a standard ENFP for example.  The first letter stands for the Sensory, and the second letter stands for the De.  Study the tables below and notice the 4 sexual versions of each, FF, FM, MF, MM.


REMEMBER TO TRACK:

• The Sensory Function (Si or Se, Savior or Demon, doesn't matter) 

• The De Function (Fe or Te, Savior or Demon, doesn't matter)


17
The 4 Modalities
The 128 types all have to do with your Letters, Functions, Animals, Saviors, Demons, etc.  Once you have a 128 type, think of the Sexuals and Modalities as another personality type overlaid on top of the 128 types.  Another way to think of this is, there are 4 sexual versions of each of the 128 types.  We are tracking 4 modalities that order themselves like the Function stack according to the sexuality of the Functions.     

 

So for example, if your Sensory Function is Feminine and your De is also Feminine, then you are FF.  What we see in our data is people with those sexual Functions have the modality order of Tester, Visual, Audio, and Kinesthetic.  Just like the Functions and the Animals stacks, the first two act as Saviors and the last two act more like Demons.  Meaning, everyone has all the modalities, but there is a preferred order/stack depending on type.

​

So when you are trying to figure out someone's type, if you can figure out which of their Functions are Feminine and which are Masculine, you'll be able to automatically figure out which learning style (modalities) they have.



18
The 512 Types
When you add everything up, you get the 512 types:

 

4 Letters x I/E = 8 Functions + Function Stack = 16 Types x 

Jumpers = 32 Types  x 4 Animals = 128 x 4 Sexuals = 512 Types


Trackable Traits.  What we have been doing since 2014 is typing people separately from each other and seeing if we can arrive at the same type out of 512 types.  Through thousands of hits and misses, we've developed a checklist and typing procedure that we continue to refine.  We are seeing that people that we independently type the same, tend to share common traits.  Here is a brief list of what we are finding of people who we believe are the same genetic personality type: 

 

- LGBTQ clusters in certain types

- People of the same type, ethnicity, and age tend to look alike

- People in the extremes (such as professional sports) tend to have common traits

- Types of crime clusters in with type (people of the same type act out the same)

- Physical health issues tend to cluster in common types

- Psychological disorders strongly cluster in common types

- Most of all, the recurring, predictable fears of each type are 100% the same

19
The 4 Social Types
When you put together every possible combination of the Letters, Functions, Animals, Saviors and Demons you get the 128 types.  There are then 4 Sexual versions of each of those types (128 x 4 = 512).  In 2022 (about 8 years after we discovered the 128 types) we discovered (and can track using our objective method) the 4 Social Types.  The 4 Social Types use the exact same "math" as the 4 Sexual Types. 

 

Just as the Sexual energy of "Masculine and Feminine" is something that humans have known of for thousands of years, so is this idea of Social Types.  There is the #1 who is born with a drive to be at the top.  The #2s are the executives who work in teams.  The #3s are the specialists and tradesmen who are the best at their own particular craft.  The #4s tend to move around from job to job because they are putting their friends and family first.  There are pros and cons to all types, but success and happiness are different for each type. 

 

Like the Sexuals and the Human Needs, we all have the four following traits (everyone has everything).  The question is, which order do you have these traits in?  Which are your Savior traits and which two are the ones you neglect?  Notice how Friends/Flexing are on a coin and Specialize/Responsibility are on a coin.



20
Dashboard Activation
In the weekly classes, we narrow down someone's type and lay out all their parts on what we call the "dashboard" (table below).  Once we have everything filled out, we take a look at what is single or double activated.  This shows us where a person is having trouble in life or is very strong.  Let's define those two terms and then fill out the dashboard below using a MF-Ne/Ti-CS/B(P) as an example.

 

Single Activated: This Function is getting pinged* by 1 of the top 3 Animals.  

Double Activated: This Function is getting pinged* by 2 of the top 3 Animals.

*Pinged is just the blue lines/wires you see in the images below.  The Animals pulling energy from the Functions.


Let's break this down step by step, starting with the two Saviors.  Notice in the image below, that the Ti  and Si both have two blue wires touching them.  And the Ne and Fe only have one blue wire touching them.  We are not counting the last Animal (the red dotted lines).  This just means that this type is getting double activation on their two Introverted (Sleep) Functions of Ti and Si, and only single activation on their Ne and Fe (Play) Functions.  This person is going to prefer to be in their inner world more and have a hard time with the Extroverted world.  Now let's break this down a step at a time like you see us do in the classes.


1) Savior Functions.  There are many crosschecks with the Savior Functions.  You should be able to see Savior Oe, Demon Oi, Single Observer, Double Decider, Savior N, Demon S, Thinking over Feeling, etc.  It takes time to see and confirm all the cross-checks on someone, but this is needed so you can build an accurate foundation of their actual type.


2) Function Stack.  If you know someone's Saviors, you can now automatically fill out their Function stack.  Remember from the chapters above, everyone has one Savior Observer, one Savior Decider, and the Function stack staggers from O/D/O/D or D/O/D/O as well as I/E/I/E or E/I/E/I.


3) The 1st Savior Animal.  If you know the two Savior Functions, then you know what the Function stack is, and you also automatically know what the first Animal is.  Ne+Ti (Oe+Di) = Consume.  So that is the 1st Savior Animal and the top of this type's Animal stack.


4) The Animal Stack.  If you know the 1st Savior Animal that goes at the top of the Animal stack, then you automatically know the Animal stack.  If the 1st Animal is Introverted, then the next Animal has to be Extroverted.  If the 1st and 4th Animals are Information Animals, then the Energy Animals are in the middle.


5) The 2nd Animal Savior.  Just like the 2nd Savior Functions can jump and be in either the 2nd or 3rd spot, so can the Animals.  So if this person is lead Consume, they could only be Consume/Sleep or Consume/Play.  In this example, they are Consume/Sleep (CS).


6) Demon Function Activation.  Think of a Function like a battery and the Animals like a light bulb (see images).  The energy of Consume is pulling from both the Ne and Ti to run.  So Consume is pulling from the two Savior Functions, and that is pretty easy to see.  But the 2nd Savior Animal (Sleep in this example) is also pulling energy from two Functions.  One of which is Ti (which is a Savior Function in this case), but the other Function the Savior Sleep is pulling from is Demon Si.  So in this step, we see that the Demon Si is activated in a Savior state because of that 2nd Savior Animal of Sleep.


7) The 3rd Animal.  Back over to the Animals, the 3rd Animal is a Demon, and we also give this one an "A" for activated.  This is the 3rd Animal, which is technically a Demon, but it is also the Function that tips the scale and makes a person Info or Energy dom, as well an Introvert or Extrovert.  In this case, because the first 2 Animals are both Introverted, this gives this person a score of 2 out of 3 of the top Animals being Introverted, therefore, this person is an Introvert.  Same math applies to 2 out of their top 3 Animals are Information Animals, so therefore they are Information dominant.


8) Last Animal.  This person's last Animal is actually their 2nd Animal in their Animal stack (Play).  This would make them a "Standard" type when it comes to their Savior Functions (Ne/Ti not Ne/Fe), but makes them a "Jumper" when it comes to their Savior Animals.  So for this type, Play is going to be the hardest Animal for them, and for that we give them a dash to signify not firing much.


9) Last Function.  Technically this person's last Function in their Stack is Si and that is still where they are going to have the biggest problems in life that they are not conscious of.  The difference here is, this person will be able to see their Demon Fe problems and be consciously aware of them.  They will still have a hard time with Fe, but they aren't as unconscious and don't have the panic attack like we all do to that 4th Function in our Function stack.


10) Function Activation 1.  Jumping over to the far left column, we are now going to mark how many and where the top 3 Animals activate the Functions.  So for the 1st Savior Animal of Consume, we are going to put a mark by Ne and a mark by Ti.


11) Function Activation 2.  For the 2nd Animal (Sleep) we are going to put a mark by Si and another mark by Ti.


12) Function Activation 3.  For the 3rd Animal (Blast) we are going to a mark by Fe and another mark by Si.


13) Function Activation 4.  We don't mark the activation for the 4th Animal (Play).  Otherwise, all four Functions would have a 2 by them.  The point of skipping the last Animal is to see where two double activated Functions are, and where the single activated Functions are.  Remember, single and double activated means what is getting pinged from the top 3 Animals only.


14) Function Activation Tips.  You don't have to do the math everytime to know where someone is double activated.  You can also memorize these tips:

- (P) Play last = Double activated Sleep.

- (S) Sleep last = Double activated Play.

- (B) Blast last = Double activated Consume.

- (C) Consume last = Double activated Blast.

So in this case, because the person is Play last, they are double activated on their Sleep Functions.  You will see us bolding that double activated Function oftentimes when we write out their full type:  Ne/Ti-CS/B(P).


15) Sensory Sexual.  The first letter of the sexual letters is always the Sensory.  So when you see FF, FM, MF, MM, the first letter is always representing the sexuality of this person's Sensory Function.  So in this case, their Sensory is Masculine so therefore we know their Intuition is Feminine.


16) Extroverted Deciders Sexual.  The second letter of the MF in this case represents the sexuality of the person De (Fe or Te).  In this case, their Fe is Feminine, so therefore their Ti is Masculine.



17) Flashing Dashboard.  Everyone's 4th Function is always their greatest problem where their painful recurring life tidalwaves come from.  The second place we all have recurring life problems is from the void we leave by not doing the 4th Animal enough (Play in this case).  So, last Function and last Animal is what is hard for everyone, and in this case Demon Fe is also going to be something that is very hard for this person.  This person has an advantage because they are double activated on a Masculine Demon 4th, so that helps them be more conscious of it than others.  But they pay for that by also having pretty big problems in the Fe department.  As you fill out the dashboard for other types you see that some people will be rather strong on their top 3 Functions, but then double Demon on that last Function.  


Below is an example of a FM-Ne/Fe-PC/S(B) that has the same Function stack as the example above, but notice how different their activation lands.

The Function Stack
A person's 4 Functions follow a dominance structure and this is what is commonly called the Function stack.  Think of the Functions like muscles and they are ordered from largest to smallest.  The 1st Function is the strongest and therefore causes imbalances because of its abusive force.  The 4th Function is weak, underdeveloped and is driven by fear.  The two Functions in the middle are relatively balanced and work well together.  

 

The 1st and 4th Function are a binary coin, and the 2nd and 3rd Functions are a binary coin.  This means if you know what one Function is, you automatically know it's opposite.  For example, if the 1st Function is Si, then the 4th Function is Ne.  If the first Function is an Observing Function, then the two in the middle are Deciding Functions.  Take some time to study the examples below and understand the math for yourself.  

 

Function Stack Logic:  

- Everyone has one Observer coin (N/S) and one Decider coin (F/T).  

- Everyone has two Introverted Functions and two Extroverted Functions 

- The Function stack staggers from O/D/D/O or D/O/O/D as well as I/E/I/E or E/I/E/I.


The 4 Quadras
There are 8 Functions and we are all born with only 4 of them.  Those that have the same Functions as you are in the same Quadrant as you (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma).  Those that have the same Functions as you, and are in the same Function stack order are the same Myers-Briggs type as you.  We will unfold all of that in the sections below.

 

We use the term "Quadra" when referring to those that have the same Functions because this is a well defined term from the Socionics personality system.  We use and build off of some terms from Socionics and Myers-Briggs because both of those systems are based off of the same 8 Carl Jung Functions the OP system is.    

 

Alpha: Ti/Fe, Si/Ne (xNTP & xSFJ in the Myers-Briggs system) 

 

Beta: Ti/Fe, Ni/Se (xSTP & xNFJ in the Myers-Briggs system)

 

Delta: Fi/Te, Si/Ne (xSTJ & xNFP in the Myers-Briggs system)


Gamma: Fi/Te, Ni/Se (xSFP & xNTJ in the Myers-Briggs system)

REMEMBER

• There are 8 Functions and you are born with only 4

• People who have the same Functions as you are in the same Quadrant

• Some people have none of the same Functions as you
