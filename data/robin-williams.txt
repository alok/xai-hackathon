("Le Nozze di Figaro
Overture" by Wolfgang Mozart)

(applause)

WILLIAMS:
Ladies and gentlemen,

may I have your
attention please.

There will be a minor change
in the program tonight.

Tonight the part of Robin
Williams will be played

- by the Temptations.
- (laughter)

ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen.

From the Metropolitan Opera
House in New York City,

Mr. Robin Williams.

(cheering)

Oh, ho ho!

Thank you.

Howdy!

Oh, wrong opera
house, thank you.

(laughter)

I would like to thank Imelda
Marcos for her earrings.

(laughter)

Thank you Imelda, thank you.

g*dd*mn, now I'm wondering what
the f*ck am I doing here?

This is incredible.

How do you get to the Met?

Money, lots and lots of money.

g*dd*mn, wonder if Pavarotti's
at the Improv going,

"Two Jews walk into a bar."

- (laughter)
- Yes.

Hello.

g*dd*mn.

This is an incredible place.

Look at this and these sets.

Placido Domingo
does The Music Man,

♪ Oh ho that Wells Fargo wagon ♪

♪ It's a coming
down the street ♪

♪ So don't let it pass my way. ♪

This lovely coach left over
from the second royal wedding.

And if you're royal
too, you have to

learn to do this all the time.

It came from this but
means this, anyway.

Thank you!

Isn't it amazing?

When you look at Prince
Charles, don't you think that

someone in the royal
family knew someone

in the royal family?
Now, come on.

- (laughter)
- His big old ears.

Boy, if you saw ears like that

on someone down
south, he'd be going

- (imitating banjo playing)
- (laughter)

Jeez, look at this,
I keep going, what...

Easy Lumpy, we'll
be right with ya.

(laughter)

How you like the play,
Mr. Lincoln?

Duck!

- (laughter)
- Thank you.

This is like a place where
Robin Leach could go,

"Welcome to Adnan
Khashoggi's living room!"

(laughter)

"Yes, this man makes
more money than

"you could ever
g*dd*mn dream of.

"I'm Robin Leach with a voice
so loud even animals go,

""who the f*ck are you?""

- (laughter)
- Thank you.

Nice to have you here,
you're a little late.

We have to go back and
start at the beginning.

We had a quick
thing, I'll show you.

(laughter and applause)

I kinda ran out, we did this,
we kinda played around,

went back, did a
quick thing with the coach.

And we walked around,
looked around here,

and basically I'm scared
shitless, I can't lie.

(laughter)

And they also have ballets here.

Ballets, men wearing
pants so tight

you can tell what
religion they are, yes!

(laughter)

Hmm, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

g*dd*mn, Oscar Levant said that
ballet is the fairy's football.

I say, yeah!

If that's true maybe
you should have

Tom Landry working
with the ballet going,

"Alright Baryshnikov, come over
here, everybody huddle up.

"I want you to take
Giselle out, lift her,

"throw her down, five yards.

- "Everybody else...
- (laughter)

"You know the ballet's not
over until the swan takes it

"in the ass, you know what I'm
saying, everybody come on!"

(laughter)

Maybe you have a choreographer

working with a football team.

"All right, everybody line
up, everyone line up.

"Oh, my God, a smorgasbord,
look at this!

(laughter)

"All right, all right,
who's the tight end?

"Fabulous, you stay
right there, I love you.

- "Okay.
- (laughter)

"All right, what I want you
to do, a simple pattern.

"Everybody run long, do this,
attempt to catch the ball.

"The rest of you push,
push, push, push, push.

- (laughter)
- "I love it, I love it."

There's a little
man in here going,

"I'm sorry,
he's not here tonight."

Hmm, take a little
sip here to relax.

God, thank you for
coming, I uh...

(applause)

Damn.

Little sip of Perrier here, I
had to stop drinking alcohol

because I used to wake up nude
on the hood of my car

with my keys in my ass.

- (laughter)
- Not a good thing.

"Hi, can I help you?"

"No thanks, it's just flooded.
I'll be okay.

"Beautiful, baby,
beautiful, yeah."

Because you're sucked
into drinking beer

by believing it's
a healthy thing.

All these beer commercials
usually show big men,

manly men doing manly things.

You've just k*lled
a small animal,

it's time for a lite beer.

Why not have a realistic
beer commercial.

What's the realistic
thing about beer?

Where you go, it's five
o'clock in the morning.

You've just pissed on a
dumpster, it's Miller time.

(laughter and applause)

It's a scary thing,
because you realize the

first purpose of
alcohol is to make

English your second
g*dd*mn language.

Eventually you may
be quite fluent.

You may be a Nobel
Prize physicist.

After nine, maybe ten
Heinekens you're going,

(gibberish)

You're speaking fluent
drunkinese, bravo.

Next thing you know you
got a couple more beers,

you've got a friend
in a headlock going,

"I love you little
fucker, I love you.

(laughter)

"That's the kind of love I
have for ya baby, g*dd*mn it."

And then you work
your way beyond beer.

You go beyond beer,
you start into wine.

For the very elegant people,
people, a lot of people

who are very elegant
are in Montauk going,

"Damn it, I wish I could've
been there, but no, I'm not."

Some people who have, you know,
I don't know whether to have

the red wine with the
fish or the chicken.

What's it matter
assh*le, they're dead.

(laughter)

The chicken's not gonna reach
up from the plate and go,

the red wine, ugh.

(laughter)

It's over with.

No, you know what I'm saying?

And I'm not talking
about Pouilly-Fuissé

or p*ssy fussy, uh uh.

I'm talking about Mad Dog 20/20.

- (laughter)
- Mmm.

You know, the very elegant wine,

the type of wine with
a lovely screw top.

A bottle of which after you can

actually see vapor trails
as people pass you.

(laughter)

How you doing?

- (vocalizing)
- (laughter)

(laughing sinisterly)

You've gone too far and
you must pay your dues.

This is why I had
to give up alcohol,

'cause you have to
pay the next day.

Pray, dear Lord, please
don't hurt me now.

There you are lying in
bed and you feel like

the scene from the movie
The Fly going,

"Help me, help me!"

The entire room is spinning
like a roulette wheel.

Place your bets,
place your bets.

(laughter)

And there's the old toilet
in the corner going,

"Talk to me.

(laughter)

"Talk to me."
Oh ho ho!

And you realize, oh
God, next stop for me,

Betty Ford Hospital.

There you are, you become
a reformed alcoholic.

You've got a steaming
glass of Perrier, going,

"I feel so much
better about myself."

- (laughter)
- g*dd*mn it.

"I feel really healthy now.

"No, go ahead, have
your cocktail.

"I'll be over in the
corner hurting the cat."

(cackles)

- Oh, g*dd*mn it!
- (cheering)

What is it about that?

But of course, there are people
in the bathroom right now

or a little late for the
show, these seats going,

(sniffing)
"Has the show started?

(breathing quickly)

"Well, you think this
has any speed in it?

"I don't know, yes,
probably Lumpy.

"There ya go."

Yes, we're talking
about cocaine.

Mmm, what a wonderful drug.

Anything that makes you paranoid
and impotent,

give me more of that.

Mmm, what a great thing to do.

Whoop, we're back
with sound again.

(laughter)

Sorry about the sound.

I got the sound from Hollywood.

(laughter)

Alright, people from
the balcony were going,

we understood him,
I guess Juilliard

helped for a brief moment.

I could enunciate
to the back row,

just like Sylvester
Stallone doing Hamlet.

This would be a place where
Stallone could do Hamlet.

- "To be, or what?
- (laughter)

"Yeah, yeah damn."

Jeez, we're back again.

We were discussing cocaine
for a brief moment.

The sound crapped out,

but that's why I'm
using Suppos-i-sound.

No one wants their tapes
back, I wonder why.

We were talking about how
cocaine basically affects you.

There's also something
called freebasing.

It's not free, it
costs you your house.

It should be called home-basing.

(laughter)

Here's a little warning sign
if you have a cocaine problem.

First of all, if you
come home to your house,

you have no furniture
and your cat's going,

- "I'm outta here prick,"
warning.
- (laughter)

Number two, if you
have this dream

where you're doing
cocaine in your sleep,

and you can't fall asleep,
and you're doing cocaine

in your sleep, and
you can't fall asleep,

and you wake up and you're
doing cocaine, bingo.

(laughter)

Number three, if on
your tax form it says

$50,000 for snacks, mayday.

(laughter)

You've got yourself a
cocaine problem, smartass.

He-he-he-he.

And everybody's doing cocaine.

Baseball players have to go
in front of a grand jury.

They're saying,
"Yeah, I did cocaine.

"But can you blame me?
it's a slow g*dd*mn game.
Come on, Jack.

(laughter)

"I'm standing out in left
field for seven innings,

"there's a white line going all
the way down to home plate.

(laughter)

"Hell, I see the guy
putting it out going,

- "" ha ha ha ha ha.'
- (laughter)

"And that damn organ music, that

(singing notes to Charge)

"The third base coach doing
this shit all the time.

(laughter)

"When he does this I don't
know whether to slide

"or do a line, you
know what I'm saying?

"And people sliding into
home plate head first."

"Yeah, you out!"

"Doesn't matter baby,
I'm up now."

- (laughter)
- Ha ha ha.

Yeah, yow!

And don't tell me, don't
tell me those old time

baseball players
weren't doing cocaine.

You ever see those old films
of Babe Ruth, with him going...

(laughter and applause)

Tell me that, he was
speeding his titties off.

- (laughter)
- g*dd*mn.

Now, there must be some sport
where they don't do dr*gs.

I mean, there're not
golfers on cocaine

sitting at the
first tee and going,

"Fore, five, get it outta here.

(laughter)

"I can't take it!

Little golf cart, ehh, "Too
slow, I'm running, I'm running!"

And you couldn't be paranoid
in a sand trap going,

"I'm never getting out
of here alive, man!

(laughter)

"I'm never getting
out of here alive!"

The commentator,

"He seems to be having
problems on the third tee."

"Why you talking so low man?

"Why are are these 300 people
walking behind me so slow?

"Look in the hole,
there might be a snake.

"Look in the hole!"

(laughter)

Golf is one of the few
sports where a white man

can dress like a black
pimp and not look bad,

you know what I'm saying?

(laughter and applause)

It's a nice thing.

I want to tell you one thing.

You don't really need
cocaine to get really high,

you know what I'm saying?

'Cause there's another way

to get really high
and it's real cheap.

Just run 26 miles.

You ever see a marathon runner?

You ever see the
look on his face?

It's the same look
like, ha ha ha.

(laughter)

"How you doing?"

"I'm alive!"

(laughter)

Yeah, and it only costs you
a pair of f*cking shoes,

you know what I'm saying?

It's the same thing.

You know why he's so high?

Because his body is
pumped full of endorphins.

It's the brain going,

"If you keep this pain shit up,
I'm gonna hurt you."

(laughter)

'Cause that's why when you run,

the first couple of miles
you're going, "I'm fabulous."

After about eight miles you're
going, "I'm not too good."

(laughter)

After about 26
miles you're going,

"Why the f*ck did I do this?"

(laughter)

And you have that look
like (laughing manically).

And you never see a guy
hanging out by a track going,

"Psst, my man, you
need a pair of Nikes?

(laughter)

"Try one shoe on, do
this for a while.

"Because you don't need it."

The basic thing to remember
about cocaine is this.

There was once a documentary,

they asked a Peruvian
Indian chief,

They said,
"Chief what's cocaine?"

He looked right in
the camera and said,

"Cocaine is our little
gift to the white man

"for what you did to us.

(laughter)

"Yeah, you take our land, we
give you monkey for your back."

(laughter)

That seems fair.
(cackles)

Don't you know that, don't
you see it now, squabbin?

Of course, I know a
lot of people going,

"You know,
Helen and I basically,

"we did dr*gs in the '70s, but
in the '80s, what we liked to do

"is get all of
our stuff together

"and go, 'mm, that gets
me high, that's it.'

"We like to look in the
Sharper Image catalog and go,

"" we don't have that yet,
we don't have that yet.'

(laughter)

"And that whole thing in
Africa pisses me off.

"Everyone's sending
food to Africa.

"Let's send some cocktails,
let's make it a party, g*dd*mn."

There's your father over there

with 15 cups of coffee,
eight cigarettes going,

"Your mother and I
never did dr*gs."

Beep,
"Come on, Pop."

(laughter)

Your mom's taken three
Valiums, she's passed out

in front of the T.V. going,
"Don't change the channel."

(laughter)

(groans) Don't you
see, don't you see.

Oh, look at this, maybe if
Japanese people did cocaine

it'd be like (imitating
speaking Japaneses).

(laughter and applause)

You have to be very careful,

because they can nail
your ass at any time.

In California you can get nailed

for not having your seat belt on.

If you're on the freeway,
there you are, you see a cop.

"I don't have
my seat belt on!"

(imitating crashing sound)

Next thing you know, you're on
the hood of your car going,

"You realize you didn't
have your seat belt on?"

- "No shit, yeah."
- (laughter)

California, we got different
type of police.

You get stopped in
West Hollywood, "Stop!

"Those shoes don't
go with those pants."

(laughter)

But you're used to police
here, a little bit easier.

Basically, your New York cops,

couple hundred
pounds overweight,

wandering around like,
"Hey."

You know what I'm saying?

He's over there going,
"f*ck Miami Vice.

"Where's my Maserati?
Nowhere, okay."

(laughter)

Somebody comes up with
a knife, "I'll k*ll you!"

"Okay, give it your best shot,
ehh, okay, get outta here,

"gimme the knife, go on.

- (laughter)
- "There ya go, go on."

It's a whole other bag.

But of course, the best
police in all the world,

you know what I'm talking about,

below that little
Manson Nixon Line, yeah.

Just down below there, when
you're going down south,

you get stopped in your
BMW there, smartass,

you're in for a good time.

(laughter)

They're the good ol' boys,

the ones wearing the
mirrored sunglasses,

with the mirror on the inside.

(laughter)

Yeah, you're ready now.
(laughs)

They usually have on assistant
that sits in the car going,

(laughing maniacally) "We
got him, Bubba, don't we?"

"We got him now,
he-he-he, squeal!

"Get ready for it,
squeal, come on,"

- (laughs)
- (laughter)

Man, you're scared
boy, you're scared.

You think you're gonna end up

in a cell with a man
named Bubba going,

"You're my little puppy now."

(laughter)

Isn't it strange to think
that if you commit sodomy

in Georgia, they're
gonna put you in a cell

with another man who's
gonna s*domize you, whoa.

- (laughter)
- This is southern logic.

(applause)

The whole country's intense.

You wanna know why the
police are intense?

Because we're intense.

We're armed, and
they're armed, yay.

It's in the Constitution.

It says you have the
right to bear arms,

and the right to arm bears.

Whatever the hell
you want to do.

(laughter)

The National r*fle
Association says you have

the right to have armor-piercing
b*ll*ts if you're a hunter.

Why?

How many deer wear
a bulletproof vest?

(laughter)

Is there one big
deer out there going,

- "I'm ready for your ass.
- (laughter)

"Come on, give it your
best shot, let's party.

"I've got a human call."

I've got a Coors,
I've got a Coors.

Isn't is scary to
think that most hunters

are people who drink
a lot of alcohol

with a heavy-caliber
w*apon out there going,

- "Yeah, looks like a deer.
- (laughter)

(imitating g*n sh*ts)

"Oh, shit, sorry Bob."

"Eh, strap him on
the truck anyway.

(laughter)

"Cut a couple of limbs off,

"put 'em on there,
they won't know."

God, we're all armed.

Here in New York, at least you
don't get a lot of handguns.

In California,
everybody's got handguns,

even ladies who're
just carrying 22's;

just makes a small hole.

- (sound effects)
- (laughter)

"I got tired of carrying my mace

"because I used to mix it up
with my breath freshener and go,

(imitating spray noise)
"oh, there goes the day."

(laughter)

It's to the point in
California where you're gonna

come home and go,
"Honey I'm home."

"Easy dear."
"Hold it honey."

"Dad, I gotcha."
"Hold it boy."

- One up there.
- (laughter)

It's Family Feud, the home game.

It's the Mansons versus the
Hinckleys, come on down.

(laughter)

Show me a*t*matic weapons,
survey says, 50% dead.

Now in England, if
you commit a crime,

the police don't have a g*n
and you don't have a g*n.

So if you commit a crime it's,

"Stop, or I'll say stop again."

(laughter)

But here, everybody knows we
are armed and it's escalating.

It's gonna get to
the point where

you're gonna come home one day

and people across
the street are going,

"I built this cruise m*ssile
to stop these kids

"from playing ZZ Top."

(laughter)

And the next thing
you know, it goes

beyond that, it's Road Warrior
on the freeways.

People start mounting
twin 50-caliber

machine g*ns on the front
of their Chevrolet, going,

"Look Helen, a slow
Chinese driver."

(laughter and applause)

No, you think you've got him
but he's in front of you going,

"Nah, I've got a flame thrower
in the trunk, you won-ton."

(laughter)

And one little old lady up
in the front of them with her

little tiny Volkswagen with
a grenade launcher, going,

"Make my day."

(laughter)

It's all there.

We're Americans,
we're a simple people.

But if you piss us off
we'll b*mb your cities.

- Think about that.
- (laughter)

Just ask the
Japanese, they'll go,

"What, we b*mb one harbor,

"next thing you know,
you nuke our town.

"But the nice thing is
you build us back up,

"you buy our products,
nice people."

(laughter)

The whole thing, and
at the top of the heap.

There's Ronald Reagan
with a look in his eyes

like they're gonna put
swinging doors in the Congress.

So it's gonna be, eh,

"I'm back and I'm pissed off."

(laughter)

He's got that look in his eyes.

Here's a president that said,

"What would this country be
without this great
land of ours."

- What?
- (laughter)

- Excuse me?
- (applause)

"Wait a minute, excuse me, sir.

"Mr. Reagan, under redundant
in the dictionary it says,

- "See redundant."
- (laughter)

"Fine, you got me on that one."

Don't you see that
look in his eyes?

He's not dealing with
the real world anymore.

Here is a man that in
a presidential debate

referred to army
uniforms as costumes.

- Mm-mm.
- (laughter)

So in other words,
w*r is the big film.

So if he launches
a nuclear w*apon,

- "That's a wrap, everybody."
- (laughter)

No, Ron, no!

Don't you see when he's
talking to Congress

he's got that look in his eyes

like it's not Congress anymore.

It's the old actors' home.

There's Tip O'Neill, he's
talking about Central America

but all of a sudden Tip's
face starts to melt to Ron.

It's not Tip anymore,
it's Duke Wango,

"Oh, forget these pissants.

"Let's get down to Nicaragua
and kick some ass."

You could see Ron go,

"I'm with ya, I'm with ya, Duke.

"I'll get the Contra ponies,
we'll be outta here."

And there's Casper
Weinberger looking

a lot like Bela Lugosi going,

"We can't do it during the day."

(laughter and applause)

Yes.

Then there's Shultz and Bush,
kinda like Stan and Ollie.

"Now you've done it, we've
over-balanced the budget."

- Hmm, there you go.
- (laughter)

Don't you see?

And Henry Kissinger,
the phantom of Congress,

somewhere in the
background going,

"They don't understand
you like I do.

"You have to understand me.
Look here, Mr. Reagan, look,

"Cambodia, Nicaragua,
Cambodia, Nicaragua, shh.

"I'll be here if you need
me, I'll be in the back."

- Wow, Ron's got that knock.
- (laughter and applause)

Suddenly, suddenly
Teddy Kennedy stands up,

but it's not Teddy
Kennedy anymore to Ron.

It's Jimmy Stewart
going, "Mr. President,

"you can't do this without
the will of the people."

Ron gets scared.

"No, no, there's no place
like the White House.

"There's no place
like the White House."

(laughter)

Thinks about Star Wars,
goes back to his room,

puts on a black robe and
suddenly, he's Obi Ron Kenobi.

Standing there,
Nancy has two danishes

strapped to her head going,

- "Help me Obi Ron.
- (laughter)

- "Help me Obi Ron."
- (applause)

Don't you see when
you look at Reagan,

he was Disney's last
wish, don't you see that?

(laughter)

Just before Disney died he went,

"Make a president."
(exhales)

And all the cartoon
characters went,

"Yeah, you heard what he
said, come on everybody.

"Goofy, you be Secretary
of the Interior."

- "Uh-huh."
- "Come on!"

(laughter and applause)

He's got that look!

There it is.

- The way he moves.
- (cheering and applause)

It's strange, though.

Don't you see the way he moves?

It's like the Lincoln exhibit
at Disneyland, don't you see?

When he gets up it's like
(imitating mechanical buzzing).

I just want you to know that...
(imitating mechanical buzzing).

(laughter)

I'll be right with
the question for

(imitating mechanical buzzing).

You expect to see Jim Henson
behind a curtain going,

"You moved him too far!
Move his arms!"

"I want you to know, the
budget's balanced now."

(laughter)

Don't you see, one day
he's gonna break down

in the middle of a
press conference.

It'll be, "Well, I..."
(imitating robot shutting down).

(laughter and applause)

He has to go now.

Basically, it's
summit time again.

A summit, a summit
is a strange thing

where they talk
about nuclear arms.

It's a strange thing,
it's like two lepers

hand-wrestling, you
know what I'm saying?

Every time you push something
wrong, boom, it falls apart.

They're talking about
partial nuclear disarmament.

This is also like talking
about partial circumcision.

- A strange thing.
- (laughter)

You either go all the
way or f*cking forget it,

- you know what I'm saying?
- (laughter)

And they go to Geneva,
where you sit down,

you buy some chocolate,
have a few watches and say,

hey f*ck it, we can't do
anything, I'm outta here, okay?

No, I'm saying you're
gonna have a summit,

you better do it in
Carmine's Clam Bar

down in the village, you
know what I'm saying?

Get a couple of people
named Vinny to go,

"Sit the f*ck down."

- (laughter)
- You get over there,

you sit down with a couple of
guys with a middle name "the,"

you know like Johnny the
Fish, Jimmy the Squirrel.

And you come over
here, you know?

"Hey Mr. Reagan, let me
get you some clams, okay?

"Ron, Gorbachev, what's
this, a map of Albania?

"Wipe that shit off,
okay, come over here.

- (laughter)
- "Over here.

"The two of you, sit down.
What are you doing over here?

"Come here, what is this, what,
is your hair from Big Boy?

"Come over here, sit down.

"Let me get you, Gorbachev
you want some red wine?

"Let me guess, yeah, you
dig, come over here.

"The two of you, you work
this shit out or you wake up

"in the trunk of a car,
you know what I'm saying?

"You gotta divide it up.

"Gorbachev, you
start off, Reagan,

"you listen and stop
doing this shit.

(laughter)

"Okay Gorbachev, you start off."

"Okay, all I want is maybe a
little bit of Western Europe,

"nude 3D picture
of Brooke Shields.

(laughter)

"Because the eyebrows remind
me of Brezhnev, okay?"

"Reagan?"

"Well, I..."
(imitating mechanical buzzing)

(laughter)

"What the f*ck are you,
a Muppet?"

(laughter)

"No, I think I should
show you who I really am."

(blows raspberry)

(mimics Nixon)
"It's me, I'm back again!

- (cheering and applause)
- "I told you I'd be back.

"It's Halloween Part 5!

"Jason's back and
he's pissed off.

"I've got the tapes now and no
one's f*cking with me again."

Richard Nixon on the
cover of Newsweek

is like John Hinckley on
the cover of g*ns and a*mo;

- not a good idea.
- (laughter)

He's back, whoa.

And it won't even
be them that blows the
tits off the world, no.

In the Middle East, there's
old Muammar Gaddafi,

or as his friends call him, Mo.

"Hey, Mo!"
(gibberish)

(laughter)

(gibberish)
You numbskull, no.

When you look at Gaddafi,
doesn't he look like

a cross between Omar
Sharif and Charles Manson?

Kind of has those faces?

He's got the handsome face,

but the eyes are
going "Helter Skelter."

(laughter)

"Helter Skelter."

They call him Colonel Gaddafi.

Sounds like he
should have a chain

of t*rror1st chicken stores.

(laughter)

Come on down to Colonel
Gaddafi's b*mb In A Bucket.

- Come on down.
- (laughter)

Bring the kids, get a
grenade, come on down.

Here is a man who had
the audacity to go,

"It's a line of death,
you cross it, you die.

"Okay, you cross
this line, you die.

(laughter)

"Okay, you cross
this line, you die.

"This line, you die.

"Okay, you knock on my door
I'm not coming out, nah."

(laughter)

What, what is this?

The only people flying
to the Middle East

right now are t*rrorists.

"Will you be sitting
in armed or unarmed?

(laughter)

"In case of a cabin
seizure a small

g*n will fall from the ceiling.

Run to the front and claim
it in the name of Allah.

- (laughter)
- No.

The whole Middle East is like
an old Marx Brothers' routine,

it's like, "Gaddafi,"
"God bless you."

"Assad," "nobody,""Hussein,"
"nobody," "you're outta here."

(cheering and applause)

"Prime Minister Botha,
white courtesy phone.

"Prime Minister Botha,
white courtesy phone."

Strange thing.

South Africa's getting
to the point where even

Lester Maddox is gonna have
to go over there and go,

"Excuse me Mr. Botha, can I
talk to you for a moment?

"George, what do you think?

"Okay, come on.

"Mr. Botha, Mr. Botha can I
explain something to your ass?

"Let me show you the
odds here, Sparky.

"There's 14 million
black people.

"There's 3 million white people.

"Now, does the name Custer
mean anything to you?

- (cheering and applause)
- "I think you gotta

"circle them up, you
know what I'm saying?

"Either you'd better
circle all the wagons,

"or learn some some
sports real quick."

(laughter)

Scary times, and
there's Kurt Waldheim.

"Mr. Waldheim, are you a n*zi?"

"Well, we had a few beers,
next thing you know

"there we are
in Czechoslovakia."

(laughter)

"What's next, Poland?"

- "Nah."
- (laughing)

"What about that picture
of you and Hitler?"

"It's like The Enquirer, they
matted it in, it wasn't me, no."

(laughter)

It's all too crazy.

And oh, there's
the United Nations

like a traffic cop on Valium.

All of this is going
down, they're going,

(imitates blowing whistle)
"Stop.

"Stop."

Best thing for the U.N. to
do right now is to go condo,

you know what I'm saying?

- (laughter)
- Scary times.

It makes you think that Jesus
Christ is gonna come back,

but this time he's not gonna
look like Ted Nugent, uh-uh.

(laughter)

He's going to look
like Charles Bronson

and he's gonna be
g*dd*mn pissed off.

"I'm not a carpenter this time,

"I'm a sheet-metal worker and
don't f*ck with me, okay?

"The first man I wanna
talk to is Jerry Falwell.

"Get his ass down here.

(cheering)

"Bring him over here,
bring him over here."

And there'll be Jerry
Falwell, Jerry Falwell going,

"You know, the Lord Jesus loves
you if you send your money...

"He's here?

"Goodnight ladies and gentlemen.

(laughter)

"Bobby, Bobby get
the plane, get the,

"Jesus, how have you been?

"No, I misunderstood the Bible,
that's all.

"I thought you said the geeks
shall inherit the Earth,

"please, please don't
hurt me." (sobs)

And all of these healers.

If that man in The PTL Club
is such an amazing healer,

why can't he make his wife's
Jiffy Pop hairdo go down?

(laughter)

Jim Baker and Tammy!

If this man has a
direct line to God,

why does his wife
look like Divine,

- you know what I'm saying?
- (laughter)

Then there's Ernest Angley
saying, "I will heal you."

But he's wearing a toupee
that's so shitty it looks like

a small animal crawled on
his head and went (gasps).

(laughter)

There's Reverend
Gene Scott going,

"I will compare and contrast
Jesus and Spider-Man."

No baby, no.

Makes you think that God's
up there looking down going,

"I gave you a nice planet
and you f*cked it up."

Everything's going
a little strange.

Our rivers are so polluted
that maybe one day

a five thousand pound trout's
gonna crawl out of the Hudson

and go, "I wanna talk to anybody
from Dow Chemical, anybody.

(laughter)

"Get his ass over here.

"I got some two-headed
babies to show your ass.

"Better living
through chemistry?

"Show me this."
(vocalizing)

"But we believe now
the accident at

"Chernobyl has been
taken care of.

"If you'd like to follow
us into the plant,

- "I'll show you around."
- (laughter)

Tom Waits once said that you
know, maybe there's no devil;

he's just God when he's drunk.

Well if God drinks,
you think that God

gets stoned once in a while?

Look at a platypus, I think so.

(laughter)

(inhales)

You think God's up there going,
"Okay, let's take a beaver.

(laughter)

"Okay, let's put
on a duck's bill.

"Hey, I'm God, what
are you gonna do?

"Okay.

"Okay, he's a mammal,
but he lays eggs.

"Hey, Darwin!
(vocalizing)

- (laughter)
- "There you go!"

Because nature does that,
nature has no rules.

It has no rules at all.

Every time you think there's
a rule for nature it goes,

"No, no." (kissing noise)
"I'm outta here."

(laughter)

If we take the planet
out, if we blow this earth

to death, we're gone,
(ripping noise) nothing.

Nature will go,
(grunts) "I'm back."

(laughter)

It'll keep going, it'll be
new forms, different things.

That's what spring is.
Every spring, every animal

has that look in
their eyes like, "Yeah."

Flowers like Barry White going,

"Oh, baby, give me
your hairy stamen now."

(laughter)

That's why your dog
looks at you like,

"Listen, man, you
got a choice, okay?

"I can either hump your leg or

"leave the house,
it's up to you.

- (laughter)
- "Your choice."

It's a time when your
cat looks at you like,

"Have you ever
seen this before?"

(laughter)

Basically it's that
urge, it's springtime.

It's nature crying
out, "Let's party!"

It's time to go wild and
do the dance of love.

It's time when male birds
do that incredible thing

where they go, "Check
it out, check it out.

"Check it out, I'm
incredible, check it out."

And the female birds are
usually going, "Maybe? Maybe?"

Yes, and we as
human beings, we are

driven by the same
sexual desire.

Men, you know you have a tiny
creature living between your

legs that has no memory and
no conscience, you know that.

- (laughter)
- You know you have no control!

There is no control
over this tiny beast.

You wake up in the
morning, he's been up

five minutes before you're
like, "How you doing?"

(laughter)

No conscious control!

He's there, ya-hah.

"Morning!
Time for jumping jacks."

And whoever you live with,
they look at you like,

who are you thinking about?
(scoffs)

He looks at them with that one
good eye,

"Nobody, I'm on my own.

"Let's play horseshoes,
get a towel,

"put a hat on me,
let's take a chance."

(laughter)

And you may be playing sports,
you may be with other men,

you've just done manly things,
you've played a good game

of football, you've just turned
your friend's face into goo.

You're in the locker room,
you're soaping up going,

"Good game, everybody."

All of a sudden he
rises up and goes

- "Hey, good game, everybody."
- (laughter)

And all your friends are going,
"Yeah, real good game, Bob."

(laughter)

You have no control!

It should be a
separate creature.

You should be able
to take it off,

boom, put him on the ground.

Take him for a walk,
he's got the rollers,

- he'd be like (vocalizing).
- (laughter)

Make it a different beast!

(cheering and applause)

That way...

You'd have some control,
at least some control.

"Heel!"
(snarling)

"Sit!"
(groaning)

You'd have some control of him,

but as it is now, you have none.

No control at all,
women know this.

When you look at it, you can
see the look in their eyes

like, "Well, it's a
ridiculous piece of flesh.

(laughter)

"My God, looks like a snail
wearing a helmet, what is it?"

Or if you're
uncircumcised, looks like

a snake wearing a
sweater, you know that.

It's ridiculous, but the
moment he starts to rise, yeah.

It's a different
case, they get that

look in their eyes like,
"Alien!"

- (vocalizing)
- (laughter)

Strange, why, why is he here,

why are we driven
by this desire?

We have lust!

Lust permeates our
soul sometimes.

Men, we are so
driven by this lust

that we have a violent streak
that comes along with it.

If we can't f*ck
it, we'll k*ll it,

you know what I'm saying?

It's like that.

That's why we make
weapons, a nuclear b*mb,

it's basically a
man's way of saying,

"I'm gonna f*ck up
the earth, yeah."

A woman would never
make a nuclear w*apon,

they would never make
a b*mb that kills you.

They'd make a b*mb that makes
you feel bad for a while.

(laughter)

See, that'd be a
whole other thing.

That's why there should
be a woman president.

Don't you see?

That's be a wonderful thing!

(cheering and applause)

It'd be an incredible
concept, that.

There would never be any wars,

just every 28 days some
intense negotiations.

(laughter)

That'd be a good thing there!

(applause)

Because you have that release,

as a woman every 28
days you can get crazy!

Your friend comes into town,

I don't think it's
a friend, do you?

How many friends make you
wanna stand on top of the roof

with an a*t*matic w*apon
and go, "Get in the house!

- (laughter)
- "Get in the f*cking house!"

No, it's not a friend.

That's why men are
going, "Well, maybe not."

- (laughter)
- (cackles)

We're driven, we
are driven by this

desire, by this
strange creature.

Wouldn't it be nice sometimes,

wouldn't it be nice if
you could go into a bar,

buy him a drink once in a while.

There'd be a big bar up here,

a little bar down here for him.

(laughter)

Go into the bar,
yeah, put him out.

He's looking up at
you with that one

good eye like,
"How ya been, baby?

(laughter)

"Sorry about last night,
I guess I got nervous,

"fired off a couple of
warning sh*ts, what the hell.

(laughter)

"But if you didn't
try and strangle me,

"I'd have a better chance,
you know what I'm saying?

"The hell, I can't go
back in there, man,

"that's some scary stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

"I'm not going back without a
wet suit and a mining helmet,

- "I tell you that.
- (laughter)

"You better work on that stuff,

"I'm not going back,
hell no, I won't go...

"Hey, forget what I
said, who's that?

"I'm going down here,
you talk to her,

"down scope."
(imitates mechanical buzzing)

Don't you see?

It'd be the only true
character witness

you could ever have
at a divorce trial.

"Your Honor, I'd
like to bring out

"a character witness right now.

(laughter)

"I believe it has a lot
of bearing on the case."

(whumps)

"Promise to tell the whole
truth, nothing but the truth,

"promise to raise
your right hand?"

"I don't have a right hand,

"but I'll give it
a shot. (whumps)

- "Mr. Phallus.
- (laughter)

"On the night of the 15th,
what do you remember?"

"Well, it was light,
it was dark,

"it was light, it was
dark, it was light.

(laughter)

"Couldn't see very well.

"The hell I'm supposed to do?

"g*dd*mn it, what the
hell am I supposed to do,

"what do you want
from me, g*dd*mn it?

"I didn't know, he's the
commander, I merely sat

"down here, I held the
testicles, I didn't know why.

"I am not an animal,
I am a sexual organ!"

It is this creature, this lust.

But what compensates for this?

There's also your heart.

Your heart is romance
going, "What about love?

"What about poetry?"
and he's down there

going, "Whatever
works, babe, yeah."

(laughter)

Then above romance,
there's your mind going,

"Ah, I believe
you're both right.

"We must propagate the species,
but we still must have

"conversation afterwards, that's
why I'm looking for a woman

"who gives mind, if
you catch my drift."

(laughter)

That's why we are driven
to meet Miss Right,

- or at least Miss Right Now.
- (laughter)

And you do, and you do the act,

the wonderful act
of making love.

And you're making love,
and you feel like a god,

and the moment
you have an orgasm

you look like g*dd*mn Goofy.

(laughs)
(taunting)

You're going,
"Yes, yes, yes, whoa!

- (laughter)
- "Is this fun or what!

"Oh, whoa, ho ho, wow!"

And if we found somebody
else it'd be even more fun.

Oh, God!

Men can't fake an
orgasm, who wants to look

that dumb, you know
what I'm saying?

(laughter)

It's an incredible thing,
'cause once a man has an orgasm

he's there, as a vulnerable
human being and then...

(snores)

(laughter, cheering
and applause)

At that point women
usually go, "I'm ready."

(laughter)

And he's there like a
little prize fighter going,

"Uncle Charlie, I coulda
been somebody, g*dd*mn it.

- "I'm melting!
- (laughter)

- I'm melting!
- (applause)

It's over, you're through.

Can't even jump-start him.

It's an incredible thing!

You try, you try, that's
when you need sexual therapy.

That's when you need
help from a little,

tiny lady like
Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

- (laughter)
- Yes, Dr. Westheimer.

Here's a woman talking
about oral sex,

and you know she doesn't
even eat pork, warning!

(laughter)

It's a wonderful way
she talks about it,

she talks about the penis
like it's a cooking show.

"First of all, take the man's
penis between your fingers.

- "Knead the bread," no, no.
- (laughter)

No, baby, don't be doing that
with my tiny Johnson, nuh-uh.

Ah baby, I'm saying if
you want sexual help,

you don't want a little
tiny Jewish lady,

you want a large black
lady named Dr. Roof, yeah.

(laughter)

She'll help your ass stand,

'cause she'll be
goddamned honest with you.

You call and say, "Dr. Roof,
I have a small penis,

"does that make a difference?"

She'll go, "Damn straight, baby.

(laughter)

"Mm-mm.

"Honey, you can't
make butter with

"a toothpick, you
know what I'm saying?

- (laughter)
- "Mm-mm.

"Work with it baby, mm-mm.

"Don't be coming at me with
that little thing, mm-mm.

"Dress it up, get some
puppet show stuff.

"Make it sing, make it
dance, this gon' be,

"oh, get that thing
away from me!

"Uh-uh, and men, men
you better learn

"some foreplay, you
know what I'm saying?

"Most men the foreplay is
like 'eh, here I come, ' uh-uh.

"Most men, women you
know what it's like.

"They grab your titties
like they're making bread.

"You know, like they're
trying to push them

"together and make
one good one, uh-uh.

(laughter)

"These are flesh,
baby, that's you.

"Don't let him grab that
stuff, you say you wanna

"make cookies, get in there,
you wanna f*ck, stay here.

(laughter)

"Don't be doing this
stuff now, nuh-uh.

"And they do this thing
where they grab your nipples

"real hard and go, 'Ooh,
does that get you hot?'

"Oh yeah.

"Oh, I'm on fire now,
Chief Smoke, yeah.

- "Mr. Vice Grip, Mr. Pliers.
- (laughter)

"And they do this
thing where they start

"grabbing your
nipples and turning

"like they're dialing
a f*cking radio.

(laughter)

"What the hell is that?

"What are you dialing,
Radio Free Europe?

"Get your ass out of there.

"Damn, what is this, oh
yeah, I'm cooking now.

"There's the woofer,
there's the tweeter,

"get your ass out of here.

"Next time a man
grabs you like this,

"you grab his little testicles,
'Oh, is that a slinky?'

(laughter)

"I think he'll wise up.
Yes sir!

(whistling and applause)

"He'll learn some g*dd*mn
sensitivity then.

"And if you squeeze, his
little eyes will go, 'wow.'

- (laughter)
- "You'll have his attention,

"he's not gonna fall
asleep on your ass then.

"He starts to nod off, boom,
'I'm back, baby, I'm back.'

"" Cause that's the way
it is, baby, and men,

"don't be afraid of oral sex,
I know most men are going

"" huh, I'm out of there,
uh-uh.'

"I say bring a lunch,
stay for the day, baby.

"And if you can't look at
it, bring a Mr. Potato Head,

"make it look like
somebody you know.

- (laughter)
- "Yeah!

"Make it look like
Sigmund Freud,
your Uncle Murray, anybody!

"Have a good time,
enjoy yourself.

"Have a good time, enough
of this serious stuff

"like men get oh so
serious like, 'Behold!'

"Get that thing out of here.

"Have a good time, and use
some birth control, girls.

"Because you better be
using something, 'cause

"those sperm are coming out of
there at 500 miles an hour.

"And a little piece of rubber's
not gonna stop that, uh-uh.

"It's like putting gauze
in front of a semi

"going, 'Come on through, '
uh-uh.

"A diaphragm is at least good
'cause it's a little tiny

"trampoline for the sperm,
you know what I'm saying?

"Doesn't stop them, but it
amuses their ass for a while.

"They're thinking 'Yo,
hey!' (vocalizing)

"Little tiny Cathy Rigby sperm
doing this stuff (vocalizing).

"That stuff keeps them going,

"makes them wonder
where they are.

"And men, if they're not
gonna use a diaphragm,

"use a prophylactic, you
know what I'm saying?

"Use a prophylactic, and I
know most men are going,

"" I am not gonna wear
a prophylactic,

"" cause it makes my penis look
like a tiny t*rror1st, uh-uh.'

(laughter)

"No, baby, put it on.

"Even the one, the
little reservoir tip

"makes it look like a Krishna,
I know, like (vocalizing).

(laughter)

"Put it on, baby, wear it.

"And don't get the
ones with ribs,

"if you want ribs, go get
barbecue, don't do that.

- (laughter)
- "Mm-mm.

"Don't get the tickler,
the French tickler one, no,

"that looks like a
damn sea anemone.

"We're not doing
Jacques Cousteau here,

"get that damn thing off.

"Just use some simple
birth control.

"" Cause ladies, the
best birth control

"in the whole world
is simply 'ha-ha-ha!'

(laughter and applause)

"Just laugh at his ass.

"Can't take it.
They can't take that shit.

"Men cannot take laughter at the
mighty sword, you know that.

(laughter)

"That's why it's down here."

But the whole damn
purpose, the whole thing,

the whole reason
you're doing all this

is because one little
sperm gets through,

bang, you've got yourself
something wonderful.

And you're lucky you get
any good sperm at all,

'cause when you're making
love, your testicle's

like a little punching
bag like (sputtering).

(laughter)

It's lucky your semen
don't come out of there

like Leon Spinks going, "I
coulda fought better, Howard.

(laughter)

"I coulda come at him but he
seemed to move away from me."

That's it, one little sperm
gets in there, makes contact,

boom, it's like a
chromosome square dance.

- ♪ 24 chromosomes coming down ♪
- (laughter)

♪ 24 chromosomes
spinning round ♪

♪ Dominant gene
means hair is brown ♪

♪ Bow to your father ♪

♪ Bow to your mother ♪

And you've just
created a tiny creature

that'll eventually quit
college on you, too.

(laughs)

You're off and running,
the wonders of life,

and women know the
moment they get pregnant

'cause there's like a ping,
and they start to glow,

and you expect to see
three wise men show up

at your door and go,
"We saw a star, dude."

(laughter)

They've got this incredible
feeling about them,

and the natural process takes
a slow, slow transition,

and three months later the
wonderful thing happens,

- the titty fairy arrives.
- (laughter)

And in one night, she goes
from zero to Aida, ya!

Thank you, Jesus, thank you.

(vocalizing)

(humming)

Even he's going,
"Who the hell is that?"

"Merry Christmas, thank you.

"Ramming speed."
(drums)

No, and you make one move
towards them, it's like, "No!

"They're for the baby."

(laughter)

"Ha ha ha, come on, he's
only got one mouth,

"let's warm them up, come on."

(laughter)

No,
no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

And along with the titty fairy,

something else happens a
couple of months later,

six months, something
amazing happens.

The hormone fairy arrives.

And her moods start to change.

Bullshit, it makes her
period look like nothing.

(laughter)

You'll come home, she'll be
waiting for you in the door

with a large knife going
(laughs maniacally).

- (laughter)
- Honey! Honey!

And the only thing that'll
save your ass is (trumpet fare)

♪ Häagen-Dazs! ♪

(applause)

Thank you.

If you leave it
there at the door,

she'll come out five
feet and go (snarling).

(hisses)

It's over.

And you'll prepare, you'll
prepare for that moment

which you think is every day,
from six months to nine months

every day you'll be
going, "Are you okay?"

And she'll be going,
"I'm fine."

"Are you okay?"
"I'm fine."

And you'll know, on that
ninth day of the ninth month,

it'll be time, because
you'll come home

and she'll have the entire
house packed in two small bags.

(laughter)

And she'll have that look
in her eyes like, "Let's go.

"Now."

And if you don't move,
she'll grab your scrotum

and pull it up over your head.

(laughter)

"I think you have to go now.

"Let's go!"

(laughter and applause)

'Cause your little
wife has suddenly

transformed into Ralph Kramden!

"Get it out, Norton!
Get it out!"

Because she is
passing a creature

50 times larger than
the orifice it's
supposed to come out.

(laughter)

It's whoopee time, get, go!

And you're driving
down the freeway, yes!

She's like De Niro
in Mean Streets

screaming out the
window, (yells).

And you think, I've gotta
get her to the hospital,

but I've also gotta get this
screaming b*tch out of the car.

(laughter)

Dear God, help me!

(yelling)

Then she'll be very
calm, "I'm fine.

"No I'm not!
Move it!"

You get to the hospital,
you think, okay let's go,

let's go in the hospital,
let's go in the hospital.

You're carrying the
bags, there's usually

one attendant going, "You
must fill out some forms."

"f*ck you, Sabu,
get out of the way.

(laughter and applause)

"No, come on, let's go!"

She's on her gurney, she looks
like a great white whale.

(groans)
"Have you seen
the great white mother?"

"That way!"

You're rolling down
the aisle, whoa!

Attendants are going by going,

"You better do it
real quick now."

Yeah, you're screaming,
they get her in there

to the operating room, which
is a very subtle, sweet place.

Bullshit, it's Earl
Scheib's living room.

(laughter)

Bright, bright lights,
she's screaming like crazy.

You're going like this,
"Let's breathe honey. (pants)

"Let's breathe." (pants)

Because you have this myth that

you're sharing the
birth experience.

- (laughs)
- (laughter)

No.

Bullshit, unless you're passing

a bowling ball,
I don't think so.

(laughter and applause)

No.

No, baby.

Unless you're
circumcising yourself

with a chainsaw,
I don't think so.

(laughter)

Unless you're
opening an umbrella

up your ass, I don't think so.

(laughter)

You're not doing diddly-squat,
you're along for the ride.

(laughs)

And you're there
breathing. (pants)

You're hyperventilating,
she's looking at you like,

"What the f*ck are you doing?!

"Why don't you knock
me out, you assh*le."

And usually there's
an anesthesiologist
in the corner going,

(inhales) "You need
anything, ma'am?"

(laughter)

She sees him, she wheels
her ass over there,

"Give me that you
dumb stoned prick.

(inhaling, gasping)

"Oh, get it out..."
(laughs)

And after 10, 15 hours
of sheer bliss...

(laughter)

You're rewarded with a baby.
(laughs)

But bullshit, it's not a baby,

it's a little old man
dipped in 40 weight.

(laughter)

Don't you see?

It's like Gandhi and
Churchill had a child,

- you know what I'm saying?
- (laughter)

A little tiny thing there, it's
a little tiny creature like

"I'm looking for the breast,
I'm looking for the breast."

It's a strange creature.

And they handed me my son,
they held him up and I went,

(gasp) "My God, he's
hung like a bear."

(laughter)

"That's the umbilical
cord, Mr. Williams."

- (laughter)
- "Really?

"Don't cut that.

"Let him dream for a while."

And they did, they cut that off.

When they handed him to
me, we made contact.

Father, son, son, father.

He looked me right in the
eye, and pissed all over me.

(laughter)

And I realize, I'm a father now.

And then comes a
very special time.

Your first test as
a father, a diaper.

You're ready, you may be
a lumberjack, you may have

been a Marine, you may
have seen blood and guts,

but you've never
seen caca like this.

(laughter)

It's incredible stuff.

It's part toxic
waste, part Velcro.

(laughter)

First time you peel
back that diaper,

it's like, "Honey,
I've got it, I -

- "This shit is green!
- (laughter)

"This is incredible!

"What do you feed him, algae?

"My god, damn!

"Oh, no.

"He sucks on mama's milk,
what's it do, go to Cleveland

"before it gets to his
assh*le, what is this?"

(laughter)

And usually the baby's down
there going, "Yo, yo!"

- (vocalizing)
- (laughter)

While putting it on his face,
got a little tiny Jolson going,

"Mommy, oh I love
you, oh I love you!"

And you're sitting there trying
to wipe it off. (cackles)

You can't, you've
got a little tiny

moist towelette,
no good that is.

It's like handling
radioactive waste

with an oven mitt, no good!

You're there doing all
this, it's all over your,

meanwhile your dog's over
here in the corner going,

"Jesus, man, why don't you
just put his face in it?

(laughter)

"Just do that.

"You wouldn't need
all that stuff."

It's foul, foul stuff.

It's so bad that, five
months later, people go,

(sniffs) "You have
a kid, don't you?"

(laughter)

"Yes. Yes, I do."

And now that you have a child,
you have to clean up your act

'cause you can't drink anymore.

You can't come home
drunk and go, "Hey,

"here's a little switch,
Daddy's gonna throw up on you."

(laughter)

You can't get stoned
because they have

toys that'll mess your head up.

If you're stoned
with a Transformer,

"It's a truck, it's a robot,
it's a, what the f*ck is it!"

(laughter)

(yells)

God, God!

And you couldn't do cocaine,
you couldn't do cocaine,

there's a Teddy Ruxpin
doll. "Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin."

It's the type of doll you
think that when you fall asleep

the doll wakes up and goes,
"You must k*ll mommy and daddy."

(laughter)

You don't need dr*gs
when you have a kid.

You're awake, you're paranoid,

you smell bad, it's
the same thing.

(laughter)

You're like, (laughs maniacally)

"The baby."

I've come home sometimes,
found my wife in the doorway

with a large knife going, "I
think you should talk to him."

You expect to walk in the
nursery and see the kid

five feet over the floor
going, "Come in father."

- (vocalizing)
- (laughter)

"Damien, put the
dog down, Damien."

Because they do horrible
things, little babies.

They go up to the
dog and go, "Doggy, ah!"

(laughter)

you can see the dog look at
him like, (chuckles darkly)

"You'd be dead
if you were a cat.

(laughter)

"But since they love
you." (chuckles)

- (laughter)
- Scary!

And then they do something
wonderful though,

just when you're about
to play hand baby,

they look at you and go,
"Daddy!"

(sighs)

Then he looks at the
dog and goes, "Daddy."

(laughter)

And the dog looks at you,

"I don't have to
send him to college.

- "Yeah, ha ha."
- (laughter)

There's nothing you can do.

My son is three years
old, it's an amazing time.

It's like big head,
little tiny body.

It's an outrageous time when
they ask you about everything,

it's like,
"Why is the sky blue?"

"Well, because of
the atmosphere."

"Why is there atmosphere?"

"Well, because we
need to breathe."

"Why do we breathe?"

"Why the f*ck do you wanna know!

(laughter)

"A year ago you were
sitting in your own

"shit and now you're Carl Sagan?

(laughter)

"What is this?

"Who are you!
Are you Buddha?

"Ask mommy, she's omnipotent,
she knows everything."

(laughter)

It's a little tiny
creature, man,

and they imitate
everything you do.

I was driving in traffic someone
cut me off, I went, "f*ck it!"

From behind me in his little

rocket seat a voice
went, "f*ck it!"

(laughter)

All day long he followed me
around the house going,
"f*ck it!

(laughter)

"f*ck it!

"f*ck it!

"f*ck-f*ck-f*ck-
f*ck-f*ck-f*ck-f*ck it!"

Sweet little old lady walked up
and said, "Oh, what
a beautiful child."

"f*ck you!"

- (laughter)
- Oh ho ho.

- It's the Williams' boy.
- (applause)

'Cause don't you see,
children, can't live with them,

can't live with them,
don't you see that?

They've got you!

They've got that
look in your eyes

like, "What are you gonna do?

"I'm a baby, I couldn't exist
in the outside world, ehh."

I see him working on
emotions sometimes,

I peeked around the
corner, there was a mirror,

he was going, (cries out)
"No, no, no, no, no, no.

(laughter)

"Ah!
No, no, no, no, no.

"Ahh!
Yes.

- (laughter)
- "That's the one."

That's the one where the dog's
going, "I'm out of here, pal."

God, it's incredible, and I try
and do sweet things for him.

I try, I say, "I'll take
him to Disneyland,

"that'll be fun, Mickey Mouse
for a three-year-old, yes.

"Mickey Mouse for a three-year-
old, that'll be incredible."

Mickey Mouse to a three-year-
old is a six foot f*cking rat.

(laughter)

There's Mickey going,
"Hi little buddy!"

(screaming)

(screaming)

"No!"

And then Goofy came
up, "Uh-huh, uh-huh."

"It's Dad having an orgasm!"

- "No, no, come on.
- (laughter and applause)

"In the car."

There's nothing.

There's nothing you can do.

And if you have children,
I know a couple of you

have children, you must
have a few and you left them

at home tonight, yeah, you
snuck out you lying b*stards.

(laughter)

you left them with
a little old lady

you hope doesn't have
a prison record, yeah.

You hope that she
doesn't drink so

when you call and
go, "How's the baby?"

"How's the baby?
f*ck, I don't know.

'Cause as you walked
out of the house

the last thing you
saw was a little face

pressed up against a plate
glass window going...

(laughter)

And you walked to the car going,
"I feel like Doctor Mengele.

"Help me!"

But you know as soon as that
door slammed, the kid turned

to the sitter and went, "Pfft,
old lady, they're outta here.

"Let's peel off these
Pampers and party!

(laughter)

- "You like Fisher Price music?"
- (laughter and applause)

'Cause that's it, you've
gotta work with them.

They've got ya!

They're gonna do to you exactly
what you do to your parents.

They're gonna come up to
you and do the same thing.

I know my son's
gonna do it to me.

16 years from now, he's
gonna walk right up to me,

look me right in the eye and
go, "God, dad, you're f*cked."

(laughter)

My father will be standing
right behind him going, "Yes.

(laughter and applause)

"Yes!

(laughs heartily)

"Revenge is mine!"

And you have dreams
about your kid,

you have dreams that maybe
one day your kid will be

up there going, "I'd like
to thank the Nobel Academy."

Then you have this other dream

where your kid's going,
"Do you want fries with this?"

(laughter)

You don't know.

You don't g*dd*mn know, do you?

Because it's a crapshoot,
it's a damn crapshoot.

And now you have to worry,
you have to worry what's

gonna happen with him, what
the world's gonna be like.

You don't even know who the
next president's gonna be.

If you graph the way it's going,
it goes from Jimmy Carter,

pretty benign, aw, bullshit, a
Valium poster child, you know?

Then the next one, Ronald
Reagan, howdy doody senior.

♪ Everybody believe me now ♪

If you keep going benign,
the next president's gonna be

Mr. Rogers, he'll be like,
"Hi, can you say Armageddon?

- "I think it's too late."
- (laughter)

Or if you get macho, the
next president might be

Clint Eastwood, and the
only man in the world

who could run against him
would be Jack Nicholson, yeah.

(applause)

It'd be truly a good debate.

It'd be the shortest debate
in the history of politics.

All Nicholson has to say
is, "How can you debate me,

"you haven't opened your
g*dd*mn eyes in 20 years.

"Bingo, you're gone, baby."

You don't know, you don't
g*dd*mn know what it's gonna be.

Maybe one day Ron wakes up,
(booming, sucking sound effects)

"I thought it was
the alarm clock."

- (laughter)
- No, baby.

Or maybe, maybe it's
gonna be all right,

maybe it will be
a wonderful world,

just like the Epcot center says.

Maybe one day we'll travel
at the speed of light,

they'll have to lose
our luggage beforehand.

- You don't know.
- (applause)

You seriously don't know.

There are times
my son looks at me

and gives me that
look in the eyes like,

"Well?
What's it gonna be?"

"Hey Zak, hey, it's, um...

"I don't know.

"But, maybe along the
way, you take my hand,

"we'll tell a few jokes
and have some fun.

"Hey, how do you get
to the Met?"

- "Money."
- (laughter)

"Yeah.
Come on, pal.

"You're not afraid, are you?"

"Nah.

"f*ck it."

(cheering and applause)

(cheering continues)

Excuse me.

Jesus, thank you.

(cheering, whistling
and applause)

Thank you.

Oh, thank you.

This moves me, I don't know
how much it moves me, but

jeez this is incredible
to be at the Met right now

and the people at the Met are
going, "You ain't coming back.

(laughter)

"I tell you that
right now, you ain't

"coming back after
what you did."

But we did it!
(laughs)

- Jeez.
- (cheering and applause)

Whoa.

This is incredible,
look out here.

I wonder, do they have ballet
teamsters, they're going

"I'm moving the f*cking set,
okay, I'm moving the set."

g*dd*mn, look back over here.

They have some prop-Mr. Hoffa,
five minutes, don't look.

(laughter)

Jesus.

Ha ha ha!

Yes.

(laughter)

g*dd*mn.

I wonder if they have
people before the opera,

the guys come down,
"Number 42, Pavarotti,

"I'll be singing
Lohengrin, thank you."

(laughter)

Hmm, yes.

Jesus, I feel like walking
away with this like,

"g*dd*mn, I played the Met, I
don't think I'm coming back,

"but this has been g*dd*mn
incredible for me.

"I wish the people in the
balcony g*dd*mn good luck."

If you remember, isn't there
like an opera rap song

when they go, people
who sing opera rap.

"I'm a rapper kinda
opera kinda thing

"can't you see it then
I feel it, feel it,

"singing' ayee, they kinda
do it in the common,

"don't you die, I say
baby, baby, sit and cry.

"Say Aria, Aria, you're my man,

"if he can't do it, Wagner can.

"Say Wagner, Verdi, Puccini too,

"come on everybody,
do what you can do

"said opera rap, opera rap.

"Looking through the glasses,
looking through the sight,

"see the things that
you do every night.

"Say elephants, goats,
dancing things.

"Soldiers walking and
the people don't sing.

"They say opera rap, opera rap,

"people there moving
in the ballet, too,

"dancing in tights 'cause
they work for you.

"Take it home baby
and I'm out of here."

God bless you New
York, goodnight!

(wild cheering and applause)

God bless you!

Thanks.

ROBIN WILLIAMS LIVE ON BROADWAY (2002) – FULL TRANSCRIPT
April 19, 2019
52 years old and not slowing down for a second, Robin Williams is non-stop for almost 2 hours as he tackles terrorism, sex, drugs, family, golf, drinking, cats, the gay mafia, and everything else you can think of.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Robin Williams!

Thank you! Oh, please! Sit the fuck down! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

[He puts his hands on the head of a woman with peach colored hair] Oh yes! Oh yes, my little salmon-head friend!

That’s it! Good night! Thank you very much! Thank you for the standing ovation, you made the orgasm up front. Let’s have a cigarette, let’s relax. We’re here in New York, fucking New York! Yes! Obviously this is not gonna be your normal night of theater! This will be Shakespeare with a strap-on! So that’s the way you like it! Welcome to my lovely set which is from the musical “Fantastic Voyage”! Or maybe the last thing a clitoris sees! I’m over here! I’m down here! This is brought to you by HBO, which is subsidiary of Time Warner, also owned by America On Line… “You’ve got mail”. I hope you don’t have stocks! Welcome! Don’t be afraid! It was so reassuring the other day… George W. Bush talked to the stock market and… It must be him talking about business ethics it’s kinda like having a leopard give you a facial. It doesn’t really work! “A lot of our imports come from other countries”. No shit?! Moving right along… Meanwhile, Michael is protesting… I don’t know, baby… It was strange enough when Michael was the best man at Lisa’s wedding. That for me was like, “You’re pushing the term, my man”! That was a pretty short list. Was Richard Simmons hunting? – “What are you doing”? – “I’m the best man”! Now Michael is claming rasism. I’m going, “Honey, you gotta pick a race first”. “What are you claiming, mistreatment of elves”? “Girl, you gotta pick a gender, too. What are you going for”? “You were Diana Ross. Now you’ve just left it all behind”. Michael, you’re not a freak. You’re just surgically enhanced… And you spend more money than the Vatican. If you go to Neverland, it says “You must be this high to ride Michael”. Obviously, people and the lawyers for HBO are going, “Fuck”! But how fucked up do you have to be for Al Sharpton to go, “I’m outta here, man”! If Al Sharpton bails on your ass, even rats are going, “Man, that guy’s quick”! “From the Don King School of hair processing…” He’s running for office in Idaho on the “What a fucking, wild, crazy chance in hell you’ll be elected” ticket. Sorry, my lips just went, “What the fuck did you say”? Couple of dyslexic people went, “Thank you, Robin”! “Thank you”! We were worried about the pledge of allegiance. We were gonna say “One nation under dog”! It’s OK. I know people are going “I’ve got a cure for this”! “One nation under Canada, above Mexico”.

But then you have to the whole… There’s anthems like “Someone bless America”! On the dollar bill, instead of “In God We Trust”, “In Gates We Trust”! “Mr. Gates, when did you realize you are creating monopoly”? “Monopoly is just a game, senator”. “I’m trying to control the fucking world”. Don’t you see Windows Millennium? It’s all leading to Information Technology. Soon it will be Total Information Technology, “TIT”. And when you’re sucking on the tit, I have you by the motherboard. Don’t be afraid! It’s a nice day in New York, my people. NY police have a catch and release program. Way to go! Stop! OK, go on again! You’re it! Get the fuck outta here! I like NY on a day like today. For a while everything went like “are you OK”?. People’re back to being newyorkers like “Have a nice day, asshole”! “Fuck you, my friend! Enjoy your day”! But the most beautiful thing about a day like today in this NY is that the ladies take the twins for a walk! Oh, yeah, the tities are out today! On a hot day all the tities are out there. And like God made them go… Beautiful tiddies, all shapes, sizes and women running, they are going… And then they hit a breeze and “chicken’s done”! Yes! Yeah, baby! These are not like the tits in Vegas, where even God goes “I didn’t make those”! Weird tits. You know fake tits are like nazis. They don’t laugh, they don’t dance, they’re just… “I’m walking here”! I’ve seen a woman turn and the tits stayed there. Babies, lucky they don’t have any teeth becayse they’d knock them out. I’ve seen tits that are really bad, like they had the nipples on the top, it looked like Kilroy. When you go up Madison Avenue you see some hardcore surgery like… “I’m so scared, but I can’t express it”. These are the ladies who’ve had so much surgery, they’re going “What are these lumps under my eyes”? “Those are your tits, madam”! – And what’s this? – Don’t ask, Mrs. Trotski! This is good news for you. And girls getting Botox injections…? – Look, I don’t have any wrinkles. – You also have no expression. You look like you’ve had a slight coma, but you’re beautiful. When guys say to you “Baby, I want you to get your tits done for me, OK”? “Do it for me. Do it for your daddy man”. And you say “OK, daddy man”! “Then I want you to get your balls done for me, OK”? I want you to get those big old basket balls. So when you do the baywatch thing, it’s like… Nothing drives a woman crazy like a big old Easter basket on her bunny. So you go to the doctor… Payback’s a bitch! Go for it, girls! Because you went through a hard time. This whole winter was so bizarre. Temperatures were like 80, 20, 30, 50. It was fucking weird! The weathermen are going, “I don’t fucking know what’s going on”! “Let’s just see what happens”. Flowers were like Anne Heche going “I’m out, I’m in, I’m out…” “I don’t know where to go”! George came back from Japan, he went “I went to the Coyote Conference” – No, it’s Kyoto. – That’s a very good car. George, walk away. And they say there’s no global warming, but right now the North Pole is a pool. It is beyond global warming, at this point it is cooking. It’s 105 in the middle of the country, and people come up going, “Is it hot enough for you”? “No, I like sweat to be rolling down the crack of my ass like Niagra”. “I like my old man tities to lactate, my man”. You see people in shorts and you’re going “Please, don’t wear those”! “Oh please, don’t put those on”! If you go to South West Airline they’re going, “Sorry, you’re not fat, you’re horizontally challenged”. Big people at South West Airlines have buy two seats. The problem is that they are not together. And you have to put your tits in the overhead rack. People don’t mind now. We’re working our way through. All over the country you’ve got weird things. In Houston they got Enron field. “We were gonna call it 5th Amendment field but fuck…” We can’t call it “We’re fucked field”! “Arthur Anderson put in the chairs, they spin both ways”. And now Martha Stuart may become somebody’s bitch. No! Say it ain’t so! I like to consider it more like “severe companion”. If you only have one room, and I like to call it my “private space”, use the light well. You have vertical bars, don’t use horizontal blinds. Also, think of your ankle bracelet as an accessory. The first time she has lunch going “You call this keesh”? Shut up, bitch! You’re inside now, you’re mine! All over things have been going good. I’ve been to Memphis, to Graceland. I never knew that Ray Charles had a decorating license. They’re some severe… They’re colours there that have never seen daylight. I’ve been to Nashville, I’ve heard people sing songs like “Take your finger outta my ass, cause I’m leaving you behind”! Funny ass shit people do now.

I’m sweatin’ like crazy up here. It’s HBO, cause it’s live. People playing baseball. You’ve got a good seat. Yankees are kicking again, way to go! You did a good job. It came through. Everybody’s worried about people playing baseball on steroids. Here’s one quick way you tell on steroids, your balls shrink and your head grows. So if someone steps up to the plate with a Mardi Gras head and Raisinettes, “You’re out”! Poor Barry Bonds! They won’t pitch to him and when they do it, they’re trying to kill him. He’s like Yasser Arafat of baseball. For Jerusalem I have an interesting plan. It’s called a timeshare, like Miami, let’s try that. Jews will get Hanukah and Passover, Christians will get Christmas and Easter and Muslims will have Ramadan and that other holiday, Kaboom. Obviously, the people of HBO are going “Oh, fuck off”! “What are you doing, you asshole”! I’m very excited because this is my time when I was watching World Cup Soccer, my man. I saw world cup, baby. There’s a few soccer fans, the rest of you are going “Uh, that’s like football without pads, right”? For the rest of the world, it’s football. For us, it’s “A strange sport, played by damaged people”. We made it in the World Cup. Everybody plays it. Not like the World Series, cause the French don’t have a baseball team. If they did, they would only have left field and no one would be safe. You know what I’m saying? What can you do, huh? It is Bastille day, alore! The day that Marie Antoinette gave the ultimate head. Look out! We are French. Fuck you, Americans, I don’t care! My friend Lance Armstrong is racing right now in The Tour du France. And every year the French go, “He is on chemicals”. “It’s chemotherapy, you little toad sucker”. Okay, he has one testicle, he’s aerodynamic. Everyone, cut off your balls. You’ll be quicker, do it! Don’t be afraid. When you look at the World Cup, America finally made it. We made it to the sixteen, baby! We’re no longer in the “Special Olympics” category. They used to see us coming “Give it to them, they’re damaged people”! Thank you for the ball. I got a ball. I shoot the ball! Unlike the Brazilians. When they play is like… And the fans are like… Brazilians are going “Look, I’m playing soccer…” “Look, I’m scoring”! “And now I’m kicking the ball”. Soccer is kinda mellow, you know. Is a little passive aggressive though. I didn’t do anything… What are you looking at? It’s not like hockey, when someone comes up with a stick and goes “Bang, motherfucker”! That’s why there are no Spanish hockey players. When a white guy takes a stick and goes… “Motherfucker, I’m going to cut you off now”! “And you, Freddie Krugger bitch, take off the mask, motherfucker”! “Coming in there! Goddamnit”! Sometimes guys do this weird thing… They fall down and pretend like… “I’ve been killed… I’ve been blinded…” “There’s nobody near me, huh? OK, I’m kidding”! And the referee comes over, “Yellow card”! Two yellow cards, “Red card”! Hold on, three cards, “Green card”! And the referee is so sweet, too. “What’s your name? Turn around”. “Why didn’t you call me after the Mexico game”? Not like football referees who have that “too much commercial time”! Mad white man dancing on the field! Moving away. Moving away. In the World Cup they always claim there’s bad refereeing, someone may have been paid off. Oh, shit, say it ain’t so! You’re telling me that the Oscars are also political? Fuck off! There’s a game mafia! The mov-hand! Fairy Godfather, “Does this pistol make my ass look big”? If you go to LA, there’s a great greeting these people do, “Love ya”! “Love you”! “Hey, love you”!

The worst refereeing was in the Winter Olympics with the French judge. Once again, the French fuck with us! The Canadians, they skate perfectly. “We did it perfect, huh”! And then the Russians they come and fuck up and the French judge went, “How lifelike, they fucked up, I give it to them, eh”? At that point I’m going “Where is Tanya Harding when you need her”? Tanya would’ve been on that judge like shit on Velcro. “Give me that medal, you French whore”! “I won”! Instead we get to see Tanya fight Paula Jones in an all white trash weekend. Trailer park Tuesday! Tanya went right for the nose, “Not the nose, that’s the Clinton money”! Next is gonna be Joey Butafuoco fights John Wayne Bobbit. There will be no hitting bellow the belt there, my friend. “Fuck, man, give that back! My balls are in the front row”! What’s next? “The Nixon daughters battle for the library money”. “Be there as my bitches go at it”!

At this point, even Caligula is going, “What the fuck are you people doing”? Why don’t you have Hannibal Lector on Iron Chef just kick out the jams? Cause we’ve got The Chamber, The Chair, Fear Factor. People in Texas are going “We got those shows”. “We just don’t film’em”. Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court banned the execution of retarded people. People in Texas are going, “Shit, where’s the fun now”? Cause they were zapping retarded people every other week. It was like, “Go sit on Santa’s lap, Timmy”. And I know the definition of “retarded” in Texas is pretty wide. It’s crazy! Even the Taliban is going “You are crazy motherfuckers”! There was a guy with one leg. They weren’t gonna give him a wooden leg. He was gonna be dead man hopping. There is a moment of compassion. Before the lethal injection, they do an alcohol swab, which is so nice! “What the fuck are you doing”? “We don’t want you to get that last-second infection”! “It’s all safe now”. You remember the Winter Olympics. They had them in Utah. Great place! What, was Amish country booked, what happened? “Come on down to Salt Lake! We’re gonna party like it’s 1955”. “Bring your wives. Oops! Come on down”! At the closing ceremony they introduced Donnie and Marie, as the first couple of Utah. I went “Uh-uh, honey, no! They’re only a couple in Arkansas”. If you’re going to Georgia, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda broke up. Jane found God and Ted found out it wasn’t him.

We’re at the Olympics once again, we’re talking about the figure skating. I find the figure skating to be kinda sexy. Not ice dancing, which is polka on Valium. That’s not good. There’s that pairs figure skating. There’s that one very special lift. Where the male skater goes… Right here! Where even a gynecologist would go “Put on a glove, man”! Who’s your daddy? Who’s your daddy? And I’m going “Let’s cut the foreplay,” “let’s have ice fucking, come on”! And she holds on without her hands! Even the French judge would go “I like it”! “I don’t care. I’m giving them the medal. Fuck the Canadians”! “So fabulous”! There’s other kinda sexual things in the Olympics, there’s the louge, about which I have only one question. What drunken, German gynecologist invented that sport? “You know what? I want to dress like a sperm,” “shove an ice skate in my ass,” “and go balls first down an ice chute”. “Ya! That would be fun”. No! This is for pussies! – How will you stir? – I will do kegels! “I will flex my ass and go down the ramp”! And do not talk to me about the two men louge. I’m saying “Boys, get a room”! “Make that turn, you bastard, make it”! “Hard right, you fucker, hard right”! Pour guy gets to the end of the run “I got wood man, I’m sorry”! “You cost us the race”! “Your penis going frr was 200 of a second winds resistance”! “We could’ve won if you weren’t going brrring”! “Dolphin boy”! There’s always some horrible drug scandal. This year was a Spanish cross-country skilor… Skilor, which is like a skier. – Are you a skilor? – Yes! They accused him of taking some performance enhancing drug. Like an elephant growth hormone. “Are you on some sort of drug”? “Are you taking an animal tranquilizer”? And they didn’t bother drug testing the snowboarders. “Go, go my little boys, have fun”! I guess they realized the word “half pipe” meant something.

Remember the kid who won the gold medal? He was in freestyle. – You wanna be on a box of Whities? – No. Count Chocula. A-ha! A clue, Sherlock! The poor Canadian snowboarder, in the 1998 Olympics, they took away his medal because he tested positive for marijuana, which is kinda redundant number one. Number two, they said that marijuana was a “performance-enhancing drug”. Marijuana enhances many things, colors, tastes, sensations, but you are certainly not fucking empowered. When you’re stoned, you’re lucky if you can find your own goddamn feet. The only way it’s a performance-enhancing drug is if there’s a big fucking Hershey bar at the end of the run. Then you’ll be like… Then you’ll be like a Swiss ski jumper going, “I’m there”! Pour Canadian snowboarder. They asked for his medal back and he couldn’t find it. It was around his fucking neck! Get out of here, you little goofy Canadian bastard, eh?

They have weird sports like the Biathalon which is like Norwegian drive-by. “Get the TV, Hans”! The Canadians won the gold medal in hockey. God bless you Canadian people. You’re so fucking nice, eh? It’s your only fucking sport, come on! That and a mutant form of football. “We’ve got 13 men, we have a longer field” “No, you have fun, enjoy”! Canada’s like a loft apartment over a really great party. “Keep it down, eh”? “We are nice. We have Jean Chritien, our great prime minister”. He was the only man in the world who said, “I don’t need no secret service” “If a guy comes to hit me, I fucking knock him out, eh”? “I’m Jean Chritien which versus your president, who’s a cretin”. Quebec keeps wanting to break away from Canada, but still keep the currency. It’s like a kid moving out of the house, -But I still would like to get money. -Fuck off you! Canadian money is also called the Looney. How can you take an economic crisis seriously? – The Looney is down! – Oh, how sad for you! What are you saying, eh? Everyone was so happy that at the Olympics the security was so tight. “Security was amazing at the Olympics”. Utah’s the whitest fucking State in the Union! An Arab in Utah is like an albino at the Apollo. You would notice! – We found one! – He’s just tanned. Everybody off! The problem was that there was basically white powder everywhere. All the dogs looking for anthrax were going “You go, man, you go”! Pour dogs they looked for anthrax and cocain. In the cage at the end of the day they’re going “I can’t taste my ass, I don’t know why…” “It’s my tail”! Meanwhile your cat sits over there going “You’re still an asshole, you know that”. Is it me, or are cats drag queens? The way they kinda go “Who loves Kitty”? “Are these your shoes”? Who loves Kitty? Who loves Kitty?

Male cats have that amazing thing, where they kinda walk around going “That’s mine”! “Mine”! “I like that too”. Thank God men aren’t like that! “Nice car, Bob. Mine now”! – What are you doing? – Just shopping! The whole anthrax thing had people going… They said “Don’t open your mail”! – Why? – There’s white powder in envelopes. “Really”!? “Your mother and I used to look for white powder in envelopes”! “We weren’t on-line. We did lines, my friend”. “And there were ninjas on the fucking lawn, trying to kill us”! And now, there are people trying to kill us. And that’s why I bought a gas mask. I can’t even get a condom on when I want to! “Hey, baby. Yeah, I got a love glove. Hold on”. “I’ll be right with you, honey”. “Don’t go away on me now”. You’re playing “Beat the cock”. “I got it, I got it”! There’s your penis like a midget in a diving suit… “I don’t think we’re going in today, Pete”. “We didn’t make the deadline”.

Remember when they sent anthrax to Tom Daschle’s office? And they cleared that fucking place out. “Everybody out, come on”! Helmets, suits, they’re all leaving. And when the Congressman walked out they go “But the rest of you, go about your lives”. “Everything is perfectly OK”. “We’ll be miles away”. It’s like when you go to the dentist and he puts a little lead bib over your balls. He walks behind concrete, going “You’ll be fine”! How can you tell if Congress was sick? It’s night of the living dead anyway. All those old senators going “The confederate flag is just the symbol of state’s rights”. Yeah, and the swastika is just a Tibetan good luck charm. When did Ted Kennedy become Jabba the Hutt? He’s huge! You’re a Kennedy, not a Maisy’s day float, come on! Bring him down. We’re voting! Step away, boy. “I said no to the Crispy Cream”.

Congress recently approved the covert plan to assassinate Saddam Hussein. So what they’ve done, is PUBLICLY approve the secret plan to assassinate Hussein. I wonder if he knows?

I know there’s a cure for bio terrorism that they sent at us. And it lies within Keith Richards, I know that. He is the only man on the planet who can go, “Anthrax? All right…” “Doesn’t go with my E. cola, but fuck”! Keith is the only man who can make the Osbornes look fucking Amish. I’ve seen him go to a drug dealer who said “I’m out, man”! “I have nothing left”. Supposedly he goes to Switzerland and changes his blood. Not like one pint, but like a fucking Chevrolette, all of it. I just wanna know who gets his blood? Some old Swiss man’s going, “Heidi! We’ve gotta go on tour, you bitch”! “We’ve gotta pay for mixed babies”. We may all be dead and gone, Keith will still be there with five cockroaches. Keith’ll go, “I smoked your uncle, did you know that”? “Fucking crazy…”

Every so often, Rumsfeld comes out and goes,
“I don’t know where. I don’t know when”. “But something awful’s going to happen”. “Thank you, that’s all for today, no further questions”. Excuse me, can you give me a clue? What is it, the Central “Intuitive” Agency now? Are you working with Miss Cleo?
“I don’t know where, I don’t know when,” “but somethin’ awful’s gonna happen”! “And definitely don’t marry that fat man”. “He only wants you for your money, girl”!
People are suing Miss Cleo for fraud. I went “Fucking duh”! What do you want? A blind tarot card before you go, “A-ha”! If she’s a psychic, why does she need a fuckin’ phone number? Number two, that fake Jamaican accent? If she was a real psychic, she’d be one of those Louisiana psychics going, “You gonna die”! “They have to puck your ass up” “so they can pull a place for your bike, come on now”! It’s like buying hair care products from Cher. She’s wearing a wig, you idiot! Take that abdominal thing… “Help you lose weight” “while it shocks your fat ass sitting watching TV”. “I’m getting six-pack abs by knocking my testicles around”! You strap that to your head. And say, “I will not buy stupid shit for no reason”!

Now we are in troubled times. When it happened, I thought the Statue of Liberty would change. Instead of “Give me your tired and your poor,” it would be her with a baseball bat going “You want a piece of me”? There was hardcore security. In NY stopping people in the tunnel.. In Washington they had F-18s flying, air cover everywhere. In San Francisco, not so hardcore security. At Golden Gate Bridge there’s a Hummer, and I’m talking about the car. One Hummer here, two National Guardsmen, same at the other end of the bridge. The problem is that the Hummer and the National Guardsmen are in jungle camouflage. For those who never been to SF, the bridge is bright orange. So I feel like going “Be vewy, vewy quiet”. “We’re wooking for tewwowists”. Airport security, before all this happened it was like, “Beep, OK, get on the plane, come on”. “What’s that? Oh, that’s a gun. OK, get on the plane”. You could carry a four inch blade, that’s about that long. Now, you can’t even carry a nail-clipper on a plane. Are they afraid you’re gonna go “All right”! “Give me the plane or the bitch loses a cuticle”. “I have a nail file. I can be irritating”. And if you have a steak or any piece of meat, they won’t give you a knife. So it’s like “Quest for Fire” flight. “Sir, you’re making a lot of noise”. The Hindu man in the back is going “Hold the bowl higher”. “Don’t be afraid to beg, use your hands.” Now the airport security is tight. You go through the metal detector and if you are heavily pierced, like some of my friends… “Take out your keys, sir”. “Tip of the iceberg”. For those playing the home game, this is called a Prince Albert. I’m sure that was his last wish. I’m sure Albert said, “Victoria, I’m dying”. “I want you to name a museum, a performance hall” “and a bolt through the cock after me”. “That will be Victoria’s Secret. Go, my darling”. “Sell little thongs to people like they had little anal floss”. And I’m talking heavily pierced. Not like Britney Spears “I’m a virgin”! Yeah and Michael Jackson is a father. Move on! I’m talking like a hoop through your nipple. You know, lady… I’m guessing! Just kinda the way your clothes are going… When you have a big hoop, what you’re gonna do? Tie up a pony? No! Or you have two. He’s and her’s towels, whatever you want! A towel down here, so you can wash up. Fun! It’s interesting when you see a girl with a bolt through her tongue. Why did you do that? “To enahthe the thekthual thtimulathion”. “Nothing drives my boyfriend crazy” “like the feel of cold steel on his hot rod”. “But the problem is I ended up knocking out all my teeth” “and living in a trailer park with a man named Bubba”. That’s the trade-off, my darling. You get the tattoo with a barb wire when you’re 18 and by the time you’re 80 it’s fucking picket fence. And Madonna turns into Margaret Hamilton going, “I’m dying, melting”. Here’s what you wanna do. When I was growing up I didn’t have Playboy or Penthouse. Sad for me! But I had National Geographic and the girls that got me crazy… You know the ones with the slinky neck going… Do that, drive your parents crazy when you come down the stairs… Or do the full ubangy go, “Mom, dad, it’s also a CD-player”. And you can take out the plate and jump-rope with your lower lip. Have fun! Watch grandma go “Shit”! Union guys going “Don’t touch it, Mr. Williams”! This shit is gonna be more precious than oil. Ten years from now, it’s already starting to happen. People going, “I got water”. “And if you want it cold, I got ice, motherfucker”.

Going on the planes now, a sweet little Southern stewardess goes, “Ladies and gentlemen, before we board flight five,” “we’re just gonna do a few random bag checks”. “These are totally random”. “I’m just gonna read off a few names”. “Has’N’T’Been’ Seen”? “Akeem Been’Laid”? “Have’N’T’Been Fucked”? “Judy Smith”? Fourteen arabs and a blonde…? And every black and Hispanic man in the room is going “Thank you, God”! “Oh, yes, we’re off the list, motherfucker, yeah”! “They man’s gonna be fucking with you now, Habib”. “You better learn to go orderly”.

They take the knitting needles from the eighty-year-old lady, “Why, cause I’m gonna knit an Afghan?” Give ’em to me! And the five year old kid, they’re patting him down, he’s going, “What are you doing? You’re not a priest, let go of me!”

So you’ve had a problem too, I guess. Father pats little boys down, like, “Good game, boy, good game! Wash up Timmy, really wash up!” They catch them, but they had the divine witness protection program. Find the priest, here’s the pedophile, here’s the priest, find the pedophile… Don’t you ask, don’t you tell, you might end up right in Hell. Here’s your check, direct from Rome, buy yourself a brand new home. Isn’t it amazing? The Pope… Applause break number two. It was amazing when the Pope gathered all the cardinals in Rome and went… The only problem is, he’s dressed like Liberace’s stunt double. I have a solution, though! For problem priests, a little shock collar, going near a kid it’s like, “You know, Timmy…” “Tommy, I think…” Or the automated confessional, could be fun. “If this is a venal sin, press one”. “If this is a carnal sin, press two”. “If this is cardinal Law, please stay on the line”. “Because you have to remember, it’s not just a sin, it’s a felony”! So we have to keep track!

Right now they’re up there watching. “Hi, Mr. Ashcroft”. We’re now under the offices of Homeland Security. Tom Ridge ever so often goes, “Today is a blue day, no, orange, red”! They had to be very careful picking that name “Homeland Security”. Couldn’t say Fatherland because a lot of the old Germans are going “That’s a good one”! But Homeland Security, it sounds like Homefront Security, which was England during WWII. Old men with pitchforks and colostomy bags, defending England! There they were, Rudolph has personally… “I threw my colostomy bag, covered him in shite” and said “Get out of that fokker, you fucker, get out”!

And I also find out now, that Winston Churchill, one of the greatest orators of all time, may have been so fucked up on cognac and champagne, that he didn’t do some of his great speeches. They were done by a man from the BBC, who also did “Winnie the Pooh”. “We will fight them on the beaches, in the air, on the land”! “Eeyore and Tigger”! And, he was fighting against Hitler! A man who recently a book declared was a homosexual, and I always thought this was a clue! That and the leather and the dancing! We are now finding ourselves once again drown to England during these troubled times. Tony Blair, a militant liberal. Over here, George W. Bush, compassionate conservative. Sounds kinda like a Volvo with a gun rack, but… Over here, Tony Blair, a man who must adress the House of Commons, which is like Congress, with a two drink minimum, crazy place! – I believe my worthy opponents… – Oh, fuck off! “Shite, bollocks, you bastard! Fuck you”! Would someone remove Ms. Tatcher from the chamber? Tony said, “This heinous incident has brought us” “to the edge of oblivion…” “But our civilization shall endure”! And there’s poor W. going, “Shit, I can’t even spell that”. Cause you look at Bush and you realize it’s Bush 2.0. It’s a beta release. He came with certain bugs in the software. “This country will not be taken hostile,” oops, delete, delete, “hostage”. And you look at him and realize he has a short attention spam. “Our economy is going… oh, look at the kitty”. He kinda reminds me of the guy in college with a towel going, “Gotcha”! You just don’t want him to drive. Some men are born great, some achieve greatness, some get it as a graduation gift. That’s OK! Historically… You must look at it from a historical perspective. He’s George the second. The boy-king. A man we thought could only lose, but somehow won, because of confused Hebrews. Yes! W. doesn’t speak while Channey’s drinking water. Check that shit out! When everything went down, they put W. out there, but they protected Channey. Channey had an angioplasty. Most people wait ’til it heals. He was like, “I’m perfectly fine”! “I’m OK”! And there’s Ashcroft in the back, “Work the arms, you asshole”! You have to remember, John Ashcroft is a man who lost to a dead man in Missouri. Choices in Missouri were John Ashcroft, Dead Man. And people in Missouri went, “I’m sorry John, the dead man scares me less than you do”. Here’s the drill for me. You know what’s strange?

It doesn’t scare me that Dubya waved at Stevie Wonder; that’s okay. Stevie’s only been blind since birth! He’s like, ‘Stevie!’ and Stevie’s going, ‘Is that muthafucka waving at me? Goddamn! Does he think I’m lookin’ for him? Goddamn!’ No, what scares me is that Dubya almost died from a fucking pretzel! They have billions of dollars in national defense. They want billions more, to up the stakes, and the President almost goes down from snack food! Secret service are like ‘Game’s over man!’ ‘Gilligan’s down! Gilligan’s down! His own dogs didn’t care! They were licking him for the salt!
[Pantomime’s Bush’s dog licking his face]
You want a dog like Lassie, a dog who cares!
[Pantomimes Lassie giving Bush Heimlich maneuver, then barks]
What’s a matter, girl? President swallowed something, and you gave him the Heimlich?
[Barks]
What else, girl?
[Feeble woof]
Mr. Cheney’s meeting with the Enron people?
[Barks again]
An Enron employee, secretary of the navy?
[Barks again]
What about the Harken loan?
[Barks]
Sorry girl, gonna have to put you down!

Oh, Kenny Boy. The Feds, the Feds are coming. Welcome, boys and girls, to Disney’s new ride. Investment pirates of the Caribbean. Your money checks in, it doesn’t check out. Sometimes you catch George unprepared and he says unusual things. – Mr. Bush, what are we gonna do? – We’re gonna conduct a crusade. And everybody in the room went… Ix-nay on the ucrade-say! All throughout the Middle East… Hide the women and children and the number zero, they’re coming! And you can’t bomb the Afghanis back to the stone age because they’ll go “Upgrade. Fun”! Today’s bombing raid has enlarged the hole from yesterday’s bombing raid. We have moved trouble from here, to here. Goat in the upper right corner, possible member of the Taliban, or “concubine”, we’re not sure. We did fire the 100 million dollars cruise missile up its ass and were successful. Operation “Extreme Redundancy” is carrying on! Then we started to drop bombs, food, food, bombs. And here’s the fun part. Some of the bombs were little yellow bombs, and the food packages were little yellow packages. So now you’re playing “Survivor The Real Game”. “OK Bob, I was here yesterday… I’m gonna go for this one today…” And what was in those packages? Pop-Tarts, peanut butter, and all you need is honey-baked ham and you got a Redneck Christmas. Who dropped the honey-baked ham on the Muslims? Why are we dropping Pop-Tarts and peanut butter on Afghanistan? Number one, it tastes a shit load better than dirt. Number two and more importantly, very difficult to have a call to Jihad with a mouth full of peanut butter. Secondly, or thirdly, for those keeping track… Afghanistan is a hasheesh smoking culture. And everyone who’s ever been a friend of the Hooka will go, “Pop-Tarts”! Yes! Got milk? Come and get me! We’re trying to win hearts and minds. How do we do that? Do we build an amusement park “Muslim Mountain” with Gadafi Duck? No! Do we have a wet burger contest? No! Do we play Cat Stevens records all day? Fuck off! Drop Martha Stuart’s tits? No! Do we have a children show called “Saudi Dudi”? No! What we must do is we gotta get a sister. You know what I’m sayin’? You gotta get a sister from Brooklyn. You know what I mean, a-ha, girl? You know what I’m sayin’? One of those bitches you see on Jerry Springer. Drop her ass in Kabul and she’ll go, “Girl, you don’t have to dress like a mother fucking bee keeper”! “You don’t have to be Casper’s bitch, forget all that”! “If he picks up a rock, cause you’re talking to another man,” you pick a bigger rock and say “Shit has hit the fan, motherfucker”! “He tries to cut off your clitoris, make you a Barbie doll,” you grab a knife and say “Lorena Bobbit time”! “Don’t make me go cobra, I will go Oprah on your ass. Don’t make me”! We’re dealing with fundamentalists… The Amish are fundamentalists, but they don’t try and hijack a carriage at needlepoint. And, if you’re ever in Amish country and you see a man with his hand buried in a horse’s ass, that’s a mechanic.

Who are we looking for? Osama bin Laden, one of 52 children. Even Freud would say, “He has issues”. What does he look like without the beard? Howard Stern, Barbra Streisand? I don’t know, I don’t care! I know this he’s a six foot five Arab on dialysis… Why is that so fucking hard to find? Look for somebody attached to their luggage. When you see the tapes of him, you see a psychopath. Wait a minute. We have some of our own! Theodor Kasinsky, sitting around with nothing to do. Ted’s played “A Beautiful Mind”, the home game. You give Ted a mailing list and some tools… Ted, these people have been bad. – Are they bad? – Very bad! – I just want a few things. – I know you do! Or we get Charles Manson. Great organizer, incredible with chicks. You can’t use him. Chucky all the time comes out for parole with a swastika on his forehead. – I’m better. – In many ways, yeah. – What would you do if you got out? – I’d kill everybody. What are we dealing with? One of the fundamental things is in a Jihad. Sounds like a country western term like “jee-ha”! And if you are in a Jihad and you kill an infidel which, I’m sad to say, is all of us, and you yourself die… you go to heaven and you are greated by 71 dark-haired virgins. Now everyone who’s ever been with one virgin is going… “I don’t know…” “For my talent portion…” Recently, there was a article in the New York Times, a Coran scholar said “The actual translation is not 71 dark-haired virgins,” “but 71 crystal clear raisins”. Slight difference in interpretation, really. It’s like finding out “thou shalt not kill” is “thou shalt not wear a kilt”. And the Scotish are going, “Fuck off”! Imagine some guy blows himself up, goes to the gates of Heaven sayin’, – Where are my bitches? – Here’re your raisins. Or 71 Virgils going, “You got a pretty mouth”! Osama bin Laden goes to the gates of Heaven, there’s George Washington waiting, “How dare you defile that what we created” and starts violating on his ass. 70 other members of the Congress start kicking the shit outta him. And then he’s going, “Where’re the virgins”? “71 Virginians, you asshole”! “I must talk to Jesus Christ”! “Where is Jesus Christ”? And Saint Peter goes, “Hey, Jesus, did you call a cab”?

I heard it. Finally the PCs. We crossed the politically correct line. It’s OK to beat the shit out of them, but don’t do the Ethnic joke. How Buddhist of you! Remember when they destroyed the two Buddhas? What did Buddha do? Nothing! What does the Buddhist terrorist do? Goes in the middle of the street, takes the gas… Self barbecue! People’re killing each other in the name of God’re going, “What the fuck are you doing”? “Making you deal with your shit”. I don’t understand the whole fundamentalist thing. I’m an Episcopal. That’s catholic light. Same religion, half the guilt. It’s frightening. Catholics have confession, episcopals have Thanks Giving, your dad has a couple of gin and tonics… “I never loved you mother, you know that, don’t ya”!? “I didn’t, dad. And she’s right there. Tell her again”. Episcopal is basicly Church of England which was Henry the 8th breaking away from the Catholic Church going, “I’m the fucking Pope now”! Then people broke away from that church, the Calvinists found him to be too loose. Then the Puritans broke away from the Calvinists, our ancestors, people so uptight, the English kicked them out. How anal do you have to be for the English to go “Get the fuck out”! “Take your pimp shoes and go”! And they land here in America going “Hello”! “We bring you guilt, syphilis and alcohol”. “Here chief, try this and once you drunk it,” “keep moving towards your feathers float. There you go”! And the Indians go “We have a gift for you”. “For us is a sacred herb. For you it will be an addictive carcinogen”. “Tobacco is a lot of fun. And a good cash crop, yeah”. “Welcome to Custers. The Casino that cares”. “This is my wife, Sits-with-a-full-house”. “It is now time for the white man to get drunk,” “and we’ll get back the land you took from us”. The Puritans stayed here and groups broke away from them and then we got the people who knock on your door at 6:30 in the morning on Sunday going, “Have you found Jesus”? You just wanna come to the door nude and go “No, help me look for him! Come on”! People like Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell say “This was brought upon us by our sinful ways”. I wanna put them on a plane, take them to the ayatollah and have world wide fundamentalist wrestling. “One time only. A life after death match for all of our souls”. “Let’s get ready to humble”! Here’s the drill. Fundamentalists take it to be “the word”. Not translatable, not metaphorical, “the word”.

In the Genesis, “Let there be light”! Could that be a metaphor for the Big Bang? “No. God just went click”. We are all descendant from Adam and Eve, then we are all cousins? “That’s right”! There are miracles in the Bible. Like when Moses, and I’m not talking “Guns ‘N’ Moses”, no! Not Charlton Heston going, “Let the Jews go or the pharaoh gets two in the head”! Charlton Heston, a man who said, “Guns don’t kill people. Apes with guns kill people”. No, Chucky! The second amendment started from people going like this… And that still continues. That’s OK! When Moses said to pharaoh “Let my people go”. And pharaoh went “In your dreams”! And Moses called the God, “God, I need some help”! And frogs fell from the sky. Or maybe there were Jews with catapults going “Now”! Thank God it wasn’t the French, cause they would go “Lunch”! “You’re great caterers, I can’t let you go, you crazy people”! Frogs fell from the sky. I would be going “Get your shit and out”! I said wait a minute! That’s what we should drop on Afghanistan. Not bombs, not food… Fucking frogs! Frogs, lizards, hamsters, gerbils, shit they haven’t seen. If you wanna get people out of caves, a shit load of NY rats. NY rats would be going “Hey, come on, raid”! “I eat pussy literarly. Bring it on”! Even then pharaoh was not impressed “Please, David Copperfield, no”! And then boils and then first born dies. “That’s it! Hebrews get out”! And everybody… “Let’s not wait for the bread to rise”. “Just get the crackers and the skin off your penis, we’re leaving”! Excuse me! Why the skin off the penis? “We’re travelling, people. You don’t want sand in there”. “And this is so passe! The dicky thing, forget it. Let’s move”! We’re going to the desert.
Then they get the 10 commandments, that would be adjusted later by certain presidents. And they get to the Red Sea. And they go “What now, Mr. Magic, what do we do now”? We’re gonna walk on the “fregs bocks”, the “frogs bucks”… Frogs backs! Thank you for watching me this far. Obviously, I did inhale. “What do we do now, Mr. Big Shot”? And he calls to God again and the sea parts. And even the most doubting Jew is going “You’re good”!
Let’s move, don’t eat the shellfish, I’ll tell you why later.
“Where are we going?”
To Jerusalem to start years of struggle, and then later to Miami to fuck up an election.

 And then the pharaoh comes, the sea closes and he calls to his cat-like God but the cat-like God can’t do shit, cause it’s afraid of water. And then there’s another miracle. The night that Mary said to Joe “Joe, I’m pregnant”. Joe went “Holy Mother of God”! She went “You’re right”! – Oh, Jesus Christ! – What a great name, Joe! “That is so much better than Shmul. Way to go”! – I love you, Joe! – Hold on a minute, Mary. – So I’m the step father of God’s kid? – Yeah. “I can’t discipline him, I can’t tell him he’s wrong,” cause he’ll look to me saying “You’re not my real dad”. – How did it happen? – It’s immaculate, Joe. “It better be, Mary! It better be immaculate”! I’m sorry I’m transforming Joe into Ralph Cramdon. Up to that point, all the names in the Bible are very Jewish. You have Noah, Moses, Zebedee and then you get Mary and Joe. We’re just a hyphenate away from Mary-Jean and Joe-Bob. We could’ve had Jim Bob, the son of God. Praise to him, Jim-Bob. He, who finds the stuff And gets me a job, Jim-Bob!

Jesus was an only child. Thank God! Who would want to be Jerry, the brother of Christ?
That’s a tough gig. “Come on, Jerry, we’re going to the beach”. “Jesus’s gonna walk on the water, feed everybody, heal them” “and get a whole bunch of disciples”. “I’ll sat there with a rash and sand in my ass. Great day for me”! He ends up in a bar at the age of 30 going:
“Yeah, I’m Jerry Christ, whoo-dee-doo”! “Yeah, I healed somebody. Come here Spot, heel! Look at that”! “Jesus is a carpenter, I’m a plumber. You do the math”! And people say to me Jesus wasn’t Jewish. Of course he was Jewish! Thirty years old, single, living at home with his parents, come on. Working in his father’s business, his mother thought he was God’s gift, he’s Jewish! Give it up! It’s an old tradition! And if he was Jewish, and many of his Disciples were Jewish, for the Last Supper, would they have not gone out for Chinese?
“Welcome to Yah-Weh. Hold on one minute, no service, no sandals”. “OK, you come in now”. “You’re twelve. All I got is two tables of six. They’re not together”. “I got one big table by the window, but you all have to face this way”.
“You are glowing, so I guess we won’t need that lamp, that’s very nice”! “You’ve just turned a Szechwan chicken into a live chicken, you very good!”
It’s said that night, Jesus turned to his disciples, and said “One of you shall betray me”. Peter said, “Is it me, Jesus”? Jesus said, “It is not you Peter”. Simon said, “Is it me, Jesus”? Jesus said, “It is not you Simon”. And Judas said “Is it me, Jesus”? And Jesus turned to him
“Is it me, Jesus”!? Thus you see two traditions beginning Jewish sarcasm and gentile humor. Together born! The next day the miracle occurred.

Crucifixion, Resurrection, and he rose again from the dead and if he sees his shadow another 2,000 years of guilt. Yes! For me, the one big question is how do you get Crucifixion, Resurrection and then chocolate bunnies, colored eggs? How do you do that one? Even kids are going “Rabbits don’t lay eggs. What is this”? And you don’t want a kid bitting the head off a chocolate Jesus. You don’t want a cream filled cross going… You don’t wanna put raspberry jam in the grass going “We’re looking for Jesus, kids, come one”! What are we trying to do? You’re trying to keep them involved. That’s why we have all the saints that did all those amazing things. They’re all there to keep your action up. And then we’re starting to lose them. Like Saint Christopher… “Chris, sorry, babe. Dashboard sales are down”. “The medals aren’t selling well”. “Drop the kid off your back, pick up your stuff, you’re outta here”. “We’re gonna have Saint Prada, all ladies accessories”. But I want a saint like Mother Teresa. She said “You can do only small things with great love”. And Pat Robinson said “She’s not a real Christian”! “Why? Cause she doesn’t have tag shelter and a university”? Mother Teresa never had a line of products, her own perfume… “Compassion” by Mother Teresa. “I smell, because I care. Compassion”! Gandhi never had “Gandhi Jeans”… “Whether you’re simply not eating or telling the English to get the fuck out”! “They come in size one and below”.

Gandhi was an amazing man. They asked him “What do you think about Western civilization”? He said “I think it would be a wonderful idea”. As beatific as Gandhi was, there was somebody in a Bombay bar going “I know Gandhi. He was a prick”. “I saw him sucking on a pork hot-dog, hitting on Mother Teresa”. “He kept saying Who’s your diaper daddy”? “I saw that with my eyes”. “If you don’t believe me, I’ll bitch slap you like Shiva”. “Don’t press this. Don’t fucking do that”! “Don’t go ding-dong, you asshole”! “Cause India has the atomic bomb, my friend”. “I could turn this whole place into Chicken Tika”. India has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb. And we’re prepared to fight over Kashmir. And your president probably thought it was a sweater. What an asshole! India detonated 700 ground nuclear tests. Pakistan detonated 700 ground nuclear tests. And your spy satellites were like Ray Charles in the Louvre. They didn’t have a fucking clue. India has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb. China has the bomb. Or maybe they just have one billion people go “Boom”! Russia has the bomb. “We have many bombs”. “We don’t know where they all are”! Maybe you want a dirty bomb. And the French have a bomb, too. Maybe they have the Michelin bomb that only destroys restaurants under four stars. They still test their bombs. They still detonate their bombs. Where did they do the underground test? In the Sahara, in the total wasteland? No, fuck off! In Tahiti! In paradise. Why? “Because we’re French”. “Oh, look a Green Peace boat’s come to protest”. “Fuck off, I sink you”. “I’m the baddest mother fucker, am I not”?

“Look, I’m giving a cigarette to a baby”. “Suck on the cigarette. Life is shit. Get to know this”. “You, Americans. Fuck all of you Americans”! “Americans, you politically correct. You cultureless crack Americans”. “We hate all of you. Fuck off”! “The Germans are here… Hello, Americans”! “I love you! Come on, Americans”. “Welcome back, Americans”! “You can build a Disneyland near Paris”. “We won’t go, but build it”. “It will have a Minnie mouse with armpit hair. It will be great”! Smoking a Galloise, going “I never loved Mickey”. “He has three fingers. What am I, a bowling ball? Fuck off”!

“Don’t love him”! But there is one country that watches out for all of us the Swiss, ya! The Geneva Convention. If there’s ever a nuclear war, they will be the only people going “What was that noise”? In their big hollowed out country, with their chocolate and their watches. Ya! The nice Germans. Ya! Or, as they like to say, “the other white race”. I have only one question. How can you trust an army, that has a wine opener on it’s knife? “Many of you, men, have never opened Chardonnay under fire”. “You take out the wine bottle, pull out the cock and throw”! “I don’t know, but I’ve been told, Chardonnay must be self-cold”. My God! Where did all this Impressionistic art come from? And all these jewelry from 1939 to 1945? Fairies must’ve brought it during the night. I have to do the Heimlich and cough up an account number. I know this one thing… I know there’s one country that is not developing a weapon of destruction. That does not have a secret weapon’s lab up in the mountains. Jamaica! Jamaica would never make an atomic bomb. They may make an atomic bong. But I’d rather fight the war with an atomic bong cause, when the atomic bomb goes off, there’s devastation and radiation. When the atomic bong goes off, there’s celebration! Smokes a split for the communion. If you don’t see Jesus then, you never will. I know only one thing. I never met me an angry pot smoker. I never met a man who said “Hey, you fucking prick”! “Oh, fuck”! “What was I gonna do”!? “Hold me, you piece of shit. Get over here”! Because you see, marijuana… I know this one. Wait a minute. If you smoke a lot of pot, you may never become a rocket scientist. Or maybe… If you seen some of the things that happened recently to NASA, maybe you can. “The Mars lander…” “I did the calculations in feet,” “but I programmed the lander in meters”. “So, instead of landing, fucker burried”! “185 million dollars… oopsy”! “Two years… splat”! “OK, fuck! Here’s a better one”! “The Hubble Telescope…” “I forgot to put in a lens”. Read the top line. “Officer Jerry, serial…” “The rest is just a black hole”. I once called Steven Hawking’s house, “Hello, this is Steven Hawking”. – Yes, I’d like to leave a message. – No, this is Steven Hawking. I know one thing though. Pot is not like alcohol. Alcohol changes your moods. Go to a bar at happy hour and see some happy motherfuckers there. See those guys going, “Hey, fuck you, my man”! “Hey, listen to me”. “Listen to me, you piece of shit”. “You do not know shit about fuck, my man”. “You want a piece of yourself”? “Step outside, I’ll kick my ass”. “I’ve already shit myself, I’m halfway there”. Some people know, you can deal with it genetically. If you’re Irish, you’ve got a running start that you can do it better than we are. If you’re Irish, you’ll kick my ass but then you’ll sing about it, afterwards. “Oh, the night you said my wife was fat,” “I knocked you down and shit in your hat”. And then you keep drinking ’til you’re in your 80s and you’re on a dialysis machine, doing liver dancing Michael Flatline. And they say the Irish saved civilization, drank a couple of Guinness and forgot where they fucking put it. But that’s all right! The Japanese drink differently than us. You could be polite during the day and all of a sudden you’re “Arigato gozaimas”. And after five Jack Daniels… “Tie the yellow ribbon”! Karaoke for “asshole with a microphone”. “Sing, you round eyed fuck, come on”! And If you want a linguistic adventure, go drinkin’ with a Scotsman. Cause you can’t fucking understand them before… You land in Scotland and they’re going – Oh, yeah. – Oh, yeah? – Sure. – Oh, fuck sure, eh? – Sure! – Oh sure, you dumb fucking bastard. And you realize how drunk they get, they could wear a skirt and not care!

And how they could invent a sport like golf. Here’s my idea for a fucking sport. I knock a ball in a gopher hole. “Like pool” Fuck off pool, not with a straight stick, with a little fucked up stick. I whack a ball its goes in a gopher hole. “Oh you mean like croquet?” “Fuck croquet. I put the hole hundreds of yards away. Oh fuck of ya, “Oh like a bowling thing?” “Fuck no, Not straight I put shit in the way. Like trees and bushes and high grass. So you can lose you fucking ball. And go whacking away with a fucking tire iron. Whacking away, and each time you miss you feel like you’ll have a stroke. Fuck that’s what we’ll call it, a stroke, cause each time you miss you feel like you’re gonna fuckin die. Oh great, oh and here’s the better part oh fuck this is brilliant. Right near the end I’ll put a little flat piece with a little flag to give you fucking hope. But then I’ll put a little pool and a sand box to fuck with your ball again. Ay, you’ll be there cracking you ass, jacking away in the sand, “oh and you do this one time?” “Fuck no. 18 fucking times.”

There you have a sport! The manly sport of golf, where you can dress like a pimp and no one will care. Where even a blind gay man would go, “Oh, dear Christ”! “Those are loud, this is not carnival! What the fuck are you on”? Even the alligator’s going, “Asshole”! It’s such an athletic sport, whack the ball, get in the car. Whack the ball, get in the car. And the commentary’s electrifying. Just this side of Curling, for really getting me going. “We’re on the third green now”. “Could people be quieter, I’d like to hear the grass grow”. I want the guy who does Mexican soccer to do golf one time. “The ball is rolling, the ball is going to the…” “Hole”! Just to see all those waspy motherfuckers going, “Oh, dear Christ”! “My God, they’re not gardening, they’re playing now, oh, shit”! “What the hell are we gonna do”?

[on the English] Golf was their last domain of dominance, they were the Kings, up until… *Tiger*
[crowd claps]
Yeees, son of a black man and a Thai woman. Even a German geneticist couldn’t have thought that one up! Remember, he goes and plays at St. Andrews, where they fuckin’ invented the sport. And after the 4th round he’s 18 under par, and there’s only 18 fuckin’ holes! So they’re like:
[in an English voice] “Oh dear god, we’re doomed! How did he learn to play, we wouldn’t let him join, dear god!”
[normal voice] And then they have nightmares of gold clubs going
[rap music]
Yo yo yo, I’m playin’ through, rather you’re a gentile, or a Jew! Remo Beach, motherfucker!

All of your gentle sports are no longer gentle. Tennis used to be… Until the Williams sisters… – 40, love? – No, that’s good love, baby! Even boxing’s changed. Remember boxing, people go, “I go to boxing to watch the sport of boxing”. Like saying, “I go to stock car races” “to see people take left turns all day”. No, you go to boxing to see someone get the fuck beat out of him. Even the guy who loses is going, “I have 18 million dollars”. “I don’t know where it fucking is…” “I’m gonna buy me a big ass house, but I can’t find it. Fuck off”! Boxing was the same. And then Mike Tyson! Mike Tyson comes along and bites somebody. Let’s get ready to nibble! All these guys’re going, “Oh, dear God, he bit somebody”! I’m saying, “You’re lucky he just bit somebody”. “Mike just got out of prison. You’re lucky he didn’t fuck him”. You bite somebody in jail its like, “Get ready bitch, you’re mine now”! – Break it up! – We’re not finished. Mike said to a journalist, “I’m gonna fuck you, till you love me”. At that point I’m going, “Someone didn’t come here to box, babe”. Mike said, “I’m on Zoloft, so I don’t kill you, motherfuckers”! I’m going, “Up the dosage, Mike”! There’s all these drugs, Zoloft, Prozac. I wanna have one drug encompassing it all. Call it “Fuck It All”. I don’t feel anything, I don’t wanna do anything, “Fuck It All”. The closest thing to a coma you’ll ever be, “Fuck It All”. I’m sitting here in my own dong, “Fuck It All”. The scary thing about drugs is that they have some horrible side effect. “May cause artificial insemination”. What? What do you mean? There’s a product called Olestra, which is a very strange thing. Olestra? What is that? It said on the little side of the chips, “May cause anal leakage”. That’s not a side effect if my ass is going… I think that’s an effect, really! “Fire in the hole”! Bad day! – How you’re doing, Bob? – Just a little anal leakage, Ted. Bob, you wanna get out of the pool right now? I want science to help me. God, look at me! Look at this! I had women in NY saying “Don’t wear fur”! The politically correct… red paint “Fuck off, lady, it’s me”! I’m a fucking Chia pet. I’ve gone to the zoo and had monkeys go… Anybody who thinks the zoo is a happy place, go and watch the monkeys wait for groups of school children. Watch the fun. The monkeys sit there, like… “Wait for it”. “Wait ’til the teacher comes with the video camera”. “Now”! Cause they’re not happy.

Even the poor animals like Ling Ling the panda, she must mate, so you can build the wing on the zoo. They go to China, they anesthetize a panda, which is kinda redundant… They bring him back to America and give him a name like Ping Pong. When his Chinese name was Who Shu Ko Hu, “Bear with Balls of Steel”. They put him in the cage with Ling Ling, saying “Go, mate”! He looks at her like, “I would never fuck her”! “That is one ugly panda bitch”. “If you were a panda, you’d know that’s the fucking ugliest panda bitch there is”. “I wouldn’t have fucked her with a koala’s dick”!

“Fuck off”! “I would rather lick my own balls, than fuck that panda bitch”! There’s only one animal who can tell you if she’s happy and wants to mate. That is Coco, the silverback gorilla. She saw me, the blue eyed simian. She was intrigued. She said to her trainer… – What does that mean? – She wants you to tickle her. OK, I tickle her… Then she goes… – What does that mean? – She wants you to lift your shirt. I lift my shirt, she reaches out and grabs both my nipples. And when an 800 pound gorilla’s got you by the tits… you listen! Then my balls went, “Somebody wants to play”. – Should we go to phase two? – No! Do not go to phase two! “I repeat! Do not go to lift off”! “This may feel like a human, but notice the placement of the tumbs”. “This is not a human”! “Do not go to phase two”! “Warning! Warning”! She must’ve sense something, cause she grabs me by the hand, takes me in the back. Daktari meets Deliverance. I’m expecting the crocodile hunter to walk out and go, “Oh, cranky! She wants to fuck his brains out”! “Watch out, boys and girls. Danger! Danger! Danger”! “This could be like that time I put my finger in a crock’s cloette”. But part of me went, “Could be fun”! Make a great story for a bar. A guy’s going “I had a wild night in Vegas”. “Yeah? Well I banged a gorilla”. “Where’s everybody going”? And you don’t want that late night phone call, “Hello”? “Don’t call me”! Maybe it’s because I’m 50. When you hit 50, the old machinery doesn’t work so well. You be at a public rest room going, “How’re you doing? Great game today, huh”? “Oh, boy”! What’s happened is your prostate is bigger than your ego now. When you’re in your 40s, you go to the doctor they have to do the old… First time is “Oh, my God”! “I’m just putting on the glove, Mr. Williams”. I went back the second time and I moaned another doctor’s name. Don’t do that! – Who’s Dr. Smith? – You’re the only one! When a woman has to go to the gynecologist, you don’t want a doctor who has a hobby. You don’t want a gynecologist who’s also a magician. You don’t want somebody going, “How are we today… Oh, a dove”! “Wow, what’s this”?! “Is this your card”? I don’t want a doctor who’s a proctologist and ventriloquist. No! “How you’re doing today”? “Take your hand out of my ass. I’m not a muppet. Move it”! In your 50s it’s no longer the… It’s the ortho-proctoscope. The colonoscopy. That’s what W. did. It’s a video camera on the end of a rodeo rudder. And it’s going up you! Suddenly, you’re your own Discovery channel special. “Slowly, we’re going up Robin’s colon”. “This must be what you see”. “Slowly up ahead, a burger he had in ’85”. – Is that a polyp? – That’s a fart, Mr. Williams. They go further up your ass, they blow air. Now you’re a fucking party favor. Oh, doctor, give me all you can take! I’m a man. Give me 120 psi! You feel like a Pinata, you think little Mexican kids are gonna come out and go, “Get the presents”! The air is coming this way. The farts are going, “Incoming”! “It’s not a… No finger! It’s the midget! “Fall back behind the shit, wait for my command”! “Prepare to make the wet sloppy noise”! Because the moment they pull that tube out of your ass, you are an evinrude! “Rolling, rolling, rolling Keep that colon flowing”! Forty miles, blowing outta you! You put on your pants and you’re floating like a balloon spinning on the America’s Cup. “Coming about, Jimmy. She’s your”! And then you realize… “Oh, shit, fire in the hole”! “Tighten up boys, we’re not gonna drop here”! “Thank you, doctor. See you next week”. “Hold the elevator”! “Fuck you, you bastard”! Seven flights of stairs. Everybody you pass, you’re going “It’s me”! Dogs look at you like “Roll over, man, you’re dead”! You just wanna borrow a match. “Give me that”! Flaming asshole. That’s what you are. You’re a flaming asshole! You’re 50! And can they make a drug to help you through all of that, to keep all of your organs intact ’til your golden years? No! Can they make a drug to give you mental clarity to your golden time? No! They’ve got a drug to make you harder than Chinese algebra! Grandpa can have wood again. – I don’t need the walker! – I see that! And your grandmother’s going “Shit! I thought the war was over”! “Get me a tetanus shot, if you gonna stick me with that rusty thing”! People have died on Viagra. They have to have the open coffin… “Oh, dear God, I don’t remember Pete being like that”. “Kids, go get some horse shoes”. “He would’ve wanted it that way”. You used to get that from some strange Chinese aphrodisiac. Like humming bird eyelash and rhino horn. To give you great masculinity. But now you’re on Viagra. You are back! You are Frankencock! You are “the Inseminator”! You are ready to go! You’re gonna be going for one hour, one hour and a half! Guys are going “Yeah”! Women are going “Uh-uh”. Cause after the first hour, your wife’s going “Yay, oh, big daddy…” “Listen, I got shit to do, OK”? “Hello”? “Yeah, I’ll be late today. Viagra, fucking…” “I’ll try and get there. Go outside with that thing”! You can’t go outside with a hard-on cause the cat just waits for you to go… And your dog is going, “Wow, you too”?! Can’t go to work like – Hey, Bob! – How’re you, Pete? “I’m happy to be here today”! Direct traffic, no, you can’t do shit! You have to make it go away. You slap it. It’s like one of those punch-me clowns. “I’m not going anywhere”! You have to finish it off. In the old days was… Now, after an hour and a half, you’ve got more semen than the Fifth Fleet. So, when you go, it’s like… Oh, my eyes! And your wife goes, “Now you know how it feels, asshole”! “Aim for the tits, Hawk Eye”! “I’m like a Lawn Boy! Get out”! “Save yourselves”! – Not the drapes! – Too late… I own them now. You run out of semen and your testicles are going “We still got an erection, chief”! “Give me blood, give me urine, any fluid”! “Oh, God, please make this fucking shit go away”! You do every goofy, fucking orgasmic thing… “Don’t touch it”! “Don’t look at it”! “Don’t even think about it”! And then you realize that God, gave you a penis and a brain. And only enough blood to run one at a time. You have lost thoughts from your childhood. And then you hear these words from your lady… “My turn”! “You can’t fucking be serious”! “Look at me, I’m Goo Boy! What are you doing”? “That’s right, Corky! It’s time to saddle up”. “We’re heading South of the border”. “You gotta please Missy”. I have one question for the ladies… Do we look like this? “Are you almost there”? “No, no, no. I will finish”! “I love you”! “I love you! I will finish”. “I can take it. I just can’t feel my tongue”. “Who’s your daddy”? “I love you”! “I will finish”.

Good night! Thank you! Thank you! This night for New York! What are we gonna do tonight, Marty? Good night! You’re the best! We did it! My pink lady…
